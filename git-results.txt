07c0faff59	Adam Porter	Sun Jun 14 10:10:11 2020 -0300	Add support to CDC-MBIM USB host driver
1da921c00f	Adam Porter	Mon Sep 9 17:08:31 2019 -0600	STM32, STM32F7, STM32H7, STM32L4, and EFM32 USB Host:  This change was required to get my devices (CDC-MBIM) to enumerate.  Initially the system timed out retrieving the USB configuration descriptor.  Ctrl IN requests got nothing but NAKs.  I found that the initial SETUP packet and corresponding IN transfer were fine; it was the Status OUT phase that was getting the NAK.  After receiving a NAK on the Status OUT, the code would loop back and issue another ctrl IN, which will always fail because the data was already transferred before. Thus the entire transfer would 'timeout'.  The fix I implemented moves the DATANAK timeout loop to only apply to the Status OUT. Of course this worked for my devices, but maybe isn't the right solution in general.  I think that both the ctrl IN and the Status OUT need their own retry loops?
5b4516d291	Adam Porter	Sun Sep 8 06:46:54 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_otg[fs|hs]host.c:  STM32 host only initiates transfer if buflenl > 0.

37c4fb5477	Adam Porter	Sun Jun 23 07:05:21 2019 -0600	In stm32_ctrlout() in the HS and FS host drivers, the data buffer isn't sent. This patch passes the buffer and buflen to the stm32_ctrl_senddata() function.   With this change, I am able to send MBIM control messages to my USB modem, and read the response.
3505cce201	Adam Porter	Sat Jun 22 07:27:15 2019 -0600	drivers/usbhost/usbhost_composite.c:  The cfgdesc pointer was initialized after the buffer had been advanced, so it was not pointing where it should. The totallen operations at the end of the function ended up overwriting memory belonging to the first copied interface descriptor.
7d42b19a8d	Adam Porter	Fri Jun 21 06:57:17 2019 -0600	drivers/usbhost/usbhost_composite.c:  I'm working on a CDC/NCM  driver and in my driver's usbhost_cfgdesc() function I need access to the class-specific descriptors. Currently these are not available if the interface is part of a composite device, since only interface and endpoint descriptors are copied by usbhost_copyinterface().  This comit will also copy any class-specific interface descriptors for use in downstream class drivers.

The ROM bootloader does not flush the FIFO before handing over to user code, so some of this output is not currently seen when the UART is reconfigured in early stages of startup.  And changes the openocd config file's default flash voltage from 1.8V to 3.3V. This is not necessary right now, but may save some hard-to-debug moments down the track (3.3V-only flash running at 1.8V often half-works and does weird things...)f91372c09d	Anthony Merlino	Tue Jul 7 19:50:24 2020 -0400	stm32_tickless.c: Fix formatting issues.

7f56da62f1	Dave Marples	Tue Nov 26 17:41:54 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  This commit fixes the clock configuration for the imxrt family. This allows WFI to be re-enabled. It also adds a few wait-for-sync loops which are necessary according to the specification but which weren't in the code. It's possible I've added a more than are strictly needed, but for this I figure erring on the side of caution is the right thing to do.

173897afb9	Dave Marples	Thu May 30 13:44:08 2019 -0600	This commit implements RS485 RX/TX switching and RTS/CTS flow control for the IMXRT family.  It has been tested on 1020 but I don't see any reason for issues on any other family member.
df2241f816	Dave Marples	Thu Dec 6 07:20:21 2018 -0600	This commit changes the lazy and non-lazy exception handler to remove a couple of cpsid instructions from them on ARMv7-m.  If my understanding is correct then these interrupt manipulations aren't doing anything anyway because prioritization stops secondary interrupts arriving and, even if they did work, they would have introduced race conditions for the period of time between the interrupt arriving and further interrupts being disabled.
d0cda60442	Dave Marples	Mon Dec 3 17:41:59 2018 -0600	In the current implementation we only use very high priority interrupts (levels 0, 0x10 and 0x20 in CORTEX-M speak) but that means there are loads of lower priority ones that are effectively unused. I have *not* changed the semantics of these levels but have 'shifted' them to be based around the midpoint of the available interrupts (0x80) rather than at the top end....that allows for interrupts to be defined above (or, indeed, below) them as needed by the application.  This should have no functional effect on existing code but adds in a clean capability to define higher priority interrupts.
ff508f9b12	Dave Marples	Mon Dec 3 07:14:16 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_spi.c:  Correct some compile problems introduced with 8328539534785bf2f26dffe9ed66554b30b60998.

9b68efe251	Dave Marples	Tue Nov 13 06:41:27 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt/imxrt_usdhc.c:  Improve SD card handling in the DMA case.  For now I think we can consider this complete for both Interrupt and DMA transfers. There is other stuff to add (high speed, low voltage, DDR etc.) later,
50a1b9eddf	Dave Marples	Mon Nov 12 13:47:44 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  This commit complete the interrupt driven USDHC1 functionality for the IMXRT EVKB. There is more work to be done to complete DMA mode and further changes will follow.

98f268b303	Dave Marples	Tue Oct 23 10:47:52 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/lpc43xx/lpc43_sdmmc.c: This commit corrects a problem in lpc43_dmasendsetup().  There was no linked DMA descriptor code on the send side.  The end result was stalls while sending multiple sectors.  This commit addes that in and the send code is working much better.

This will result it the deferred free.   We will take it when not held and do the free when we can get the count because there was no holder.

This change adds logic to invalidate the data cache less frequently by monitoring the state of the Rx DMA buffer cache coherency and invalidating only regions as necessary.  This commit also reverts commit e17d8c719e2b79bd9f55c0b6e63b7bf2a6fb68f4 which has a logic error in cases where data is removed  from the Rx DMA buffer at a rate higher than it is added to the Rx DMA buffer.

It contains IOCTL definitions that are needed by applications.  Usage of a chip-specific header file is, however, not really a good portable design because it requires that the application know that it is running on a specific chip.  But still, if we are going to do that, the include directory is where the header file belongs.  My apologies for the bad judgement.

In someplaces, getitimer() and setitimer() depend on CONFIG_DISABLE_POSIX_TIMERS=n and in other places they depend on nothing.  As a result, there are link failures when CONFIG_DISABLE_POSIX_TIMERS=y.  Which is correct?  On one hand, these interfaces are not POSIX timers, so conditioning them on on CONFIG_DISABLE_POSIX_TIMERS.  I opted to keep the dependence and just apply it consistently.  I did this because setitimer() and getitimer() are seldom used so it is really best if a system call is no generated for them in all cases.

2a22a64f36	Gregory Nutt	Tue Oct 29 16:02:33 2019 -0600	drivers/wireless/ieee80211/mmc_sdio.c:  In sdio_io_rw_extended(), the behavior of the DMA setup differs, depending on the hardware capability SDIO_CAPS_DMABEFOREWRITE.  If this capability is set, then the DMA setup much be done before the transfer setup.  Dave Marples modified this file for the i.MXRT USDHC which does have the SDIO_CAPS_DMABEFOREWRITE (commit 970295d0fe89c73527c7e283ea6f244d9668fe79).  Xiao Xiang reports that this change breaks the Wifi on the Photon which does not report the SDIO_CAPS_DMABEFOREWRITE and suggests reverting the change.  In reality both changes are correct but must be conditioned on the DMA capability of the underlying SDIO device.

There is not relationship be CONFIG_STM32_USBHOST and CONFIG_USBHOST, yet they they are used interchangably.  This means that can (and did) get out of synch causing link time failures.  This commit adds logic to select CONFIG_USBHOST when CONFIG_STM32_USBHOST is selected, keeping the two settings syncrhonized.  Furthermore, since CONFIG_STM32_USBHOST is the authoritative setting, all ocurrences of CONFIG_USBHOST were replaced with CONFIG_STM32_USBHOST in the architecture code and in this one board code that was producing the error in build testing.

That is because you never now how the configuration will be set.  CONFIG_LIB_BOARDCTL may be auto-selected by applications that need boardctl() support... requiring the existence of board_app_initialize().

8d87e624bf	Gregory Nutt	Tue Sep 17 05:41:10 2019 -0600	boards/arm/cxd56xx/spresense/Kconfig:  Add a configuration to select if an extension board is attached to the SPresence.  If there is no extension board attached, the SPresense may run in a low-power mode by default (as determined by the CONFIG_CXD56_CUSTOM_PINCONFIG option).  If an extension board is present, then the SPresense will need to run at a higher power mode, selected by the new CONFIG_SPRESENSE_EXTENSION option.

5995714cfd	Gregory Nutt	Mon Sep 16 08:14:32 2019 -0600	boards/mips Linker Scripts:  The PIC32M* start-up code initializes .bss by writing 16 bytes at a time in a loop.  The start (_sbss) alignment is only required to be 4 bytes since the write is done with 4 store instructions.  In a previous change, the end address, _ebss, was aligned to 16 byte to prevent initializing past the end off the .bss region.  However, that does not work unless the start address, _sbss, is also aligned to 16 bytes.

By default, these registers are disabled.  Suggested by Juha Niskanen.
bbbe9d85c5	Gregory Nutt	Thu Sep 12 09:57:50 2019 -0600	Move EXIDX assignments inside of braces so that we can be assure that the symbols have the correct alignment.  Suggested by Daniel P. Volpato

50f9e26d5d	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 11 21:10:51 2019 -0600	Modify all a few more linker scripts  missed in 415e3d34482012ab308, probably because they were created after 2eb4fe5ffb7dee21b33.
254a906409	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 11 12:37:29 2019 -0600	libs/libc/builtin/: builtint_isavail() should not set the errno variable because this functions may be used by internal OS logic for which setting the rrno variable would be inappropriate.

5707d01cc3	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 7 09:14:21 2019 -0600	tools/version.h and Makefile.unix:  Minor improvement to previous commit:  Permit custom version strings that do not derive from the major and minor version number
d07666c85b	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 7 08:44:16 2019 -0600	tools/Makefile.unix:  Rethink creation of new .version file with GIT information.  Cannot use 'sed -i' in its current form because that does not work on macOS, FreeBSD, or NetBSD.
c5066f9f4c	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 6 16:01:38 2019 -0600	net/ipforward/ipv4_forward.c:  Correct some errors introduced with commit a52ceac13ee598696cb907b62326bfd4c111ac6c.  Noted by Adam Porter.

38ada48454	Gregory Nutt	Tue Sep 3 11:35:31 2019 -0600	libc/libc/unistd/:  Add stubs for setreuid(), and setregid().  NuttX does not currently support effective user/group IDs, but these stubs will support linkage of applications that expect these POSIX standard interfaces.
a2bf7057f6	Gregory Nutt	Tue Sep 3 10:57:51 2019 -0600	libc/libc/unistd/:  Add stubs for geteuid(), getegid(), seteuid(), and setegid().  NuttX does not currently support effective user/group IDs, but these stubs will support linkage of appliations that expect these POSIX standard interfaces.

85770966ff	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 1 12:19:36 2019 -0600	boards/Board.mk:  Add support to pass dependency paths.  boards/arm/cxd56xx/common/Makefile:  Add correct dependency paths for board/ and src/ subdirectories.
d596e56c3d	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 1 11:23:40 2019 -0600	net/local/local_conn.c:  Removed un-ncessary memset().  Connection structure is allocated with kmm_zalloc() which will clear all memory.
6266e067e9	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 1 08:47:01 2019 -0600	net/:  Re-order the content of all address-family socket 'connection' structures so that they begin with a comomon prologue.  This permits better use of logic for different address family types.
19e1db3f97	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 31 17:54:38 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32/hardware/stm32_adc_*:  Additional coding standard issues:  Binary operators should be separated with spaces.

5f57b85438	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 31 17:12:15 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_adc.c:  Another fix.  adc_calibrate was called even when it was conditioned out, causing a link time failure.
70fcf486a0	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 31 17:06:24 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_adc.c:  Corect an error found in build testing.  Recent commit to add STM32F1 calibration was not properly conditioned.  Caused compilation errors on all STM32 F2 family members.
c6434e3182	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 31 14:35:17 2019 -0600	boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/lx_cpu/configs/nsh/defconfig:  Correct shit defconfig file.  Recent patch dumped a prohibited .config file as the defconfig file when a proper defconfig file created via 'make savdefconfig' is required.  Bad.
a52ceac13e	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 31 12:25:30 2019 -0600	net/:  Now handles reception of IPv4 packets with larger IPv4 headers containing options.
9bdde04636	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 31 09:08:32 2019 -0600	net/Kconfig:  Ethernet packet buffer size cannot be permitted to go below 1294 is IPv6 is selected.
89096d0fc7	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 30 09:28:47 2019 -0600	tools/Makefile.win:  Port changes of commit 3ed844640d25b854457b6cc08f89d907072c0054 to Makefile.win.  Untested because I don't have a Windows native build platform setup.  There have been a log of changes to the build system lately do to directory re-organization so likely the native build is broken.  Certainly tools/configure.bat should be replaces with tools/configure.c.
e5c3874a3b	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 30 08:46:57 2019 -0600	Tiva directories:  Fix TM4C129XNCZAD part number in Kconfig and identifiers.  Rationale: Fully specify that this is the 212-pin BGA package (ZAD ending) and for consistency with earlier changes to other Tiva TM4C12x part numbers in Kconfig names and identifiers.
dc09d7018b	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 30 08:37:27 2019 -0600	Coding style fixes.  Run every new file through tools/nxstyle to assure that it is close to the NuttX coding standard.

58743b7488	Gregory Nutt	Thu Aug 29 10:03:01 2019 -0600	The non-standard, non-portable type cpu_set_t was created specifically to support the NuttX internal, SMP implementation.  Any resemblance to any other cpu_set_t would be purely coincidental.  However it appears that that coincidence has occurred.  cpu_set_t is an equivalent, non-standard, non-portable type in the GNU C library.  Compilation of libgnat expects this non-standard type to be defined.  Who am I to standard in the way of progress?  This commit removes the conditioning on CONFIG_SMP so that cpu_set_t is typed (as a uint8_t) even if CONFIG_SMP is not defined.  Reference:  Bitbucket issue 164.
53d5e44d89	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 28 15:14:27 2019 -0600	Cosmetic updates.
6c5b8a70a7	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 28 08:11:10 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt/hardware/imxrt_enc.h:  Fix some errors in register bit definitions.  Noted by Arie de Muijnck.
b912c6fbff	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 27 18:18:10 2019 -0600	sched/clock/clock_timekeeping.c:  fix cases in time conversion that must be >= NSEC_PER_SEC, not >NSEC_PER_SEC.  Similar to fix of f9e80c4a1e2da24d402fa51affc59fd43b694a12.
5f02b0335f	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 27 16:41:07 2019 -0600	syscall/ and related:  Fix an error found in build testing.  Inconsistent conditional compilation led to link errors in certain configurations.

dbd1bb1f1e	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 26 17:28:21 2019 -0600	All function pointer types should be prefaced by the qualifier CODE (unless the callable function is known to reside in RAM, then it should be FAR).
9bd850295e	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 26 13:09:57 2019 -0600	arch/sim/src/Makefile: Fix dependency problem due to reorganization of some directories.

65aabe3048	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 25 19:28:04 2019 -0600	libs/symtab:  move symtab/ to libs/symtab.  Let's no clutter up the top level directory.  Shorten CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_GENERATE_SYSTEM_SYSTAB to just CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_SYSTEM_SYMTAB.  Some items in syscall/syscall.csv are only valid when CONFIG_LIB_SYSCALL is defined.  That is always defined when really building the syatem calls, but causes errors in libs/symtab because they are not valid in the normal, FLAT build context.
da9433a4c7	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 25 18:37:23 2019 -0600	Fix another warnings and an error in typing introduced in the previous commit related to BINFS in PROTECTED mode.
19b94da468	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 25 17:37:13 2019 -0600	Fix a couple of warnings in last commit (one was really an error).
f751aff7fe	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 25 16:58:43 2019 -0600	boards/boardctl.c and libs/libc/builtin:  The BINFS file system uses the same builtin library and builtin arrays as does NSH.  The builtin arrays are simple name-value pairs that map builtin function names with the user-space entry point.  In the FLAT build, the builtin arrays are available everywhere via the backdoor left open by the FLAT address space.  In the PROTECTED build, however, the kernel must maintain its own reference to the user-space builtin array.  This commits adds those kernel globals and a new boardctl(BOARDIOC_BUILTINS) that can be used by applications to the provide the builtin list reference to the kernel.

Some dividers may have a function range of 1..8 but the register value is 0..7.  There were several places where values were getting decremented twice:  Once by higher up logic and once by the register access logic.  A such dividers were reviewed and, hopefully, all were fixed.

545cfada38	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 9 10:52:35 2019 -0600	This commit removes CONFIG_ARCH_INT_DISABLEALL.  In the normal course of things, interrupts must occasionally be disabled using the up_irq_save() inline function to prevent contention in use of resources that may be shared between interrupt level and non-interrupt level logic.  Now the question arises, if we are using BASEPRI to disable interrupts and have high priority interrupts enabled (CONFIG_ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT=y), do we disable all interrupts except SVCall (we cannot disable SVCall interrupts).  Or do we only disable the "normal" interrupts?
851285d729	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 9 08:04:01 2019 -0600	Documentation/NuttX.html:  Adjust URLs to board README.txt files to account for changes in boards/ sub-directory reorganization.
c300f27130	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 9 07:07:16 2019 -0600	arch/arm/include/armv7-m/nvicpri.h:  In the 'normal' case, the priority of the SVCALL interrupt was the same as the priority of the high priority interrupt.  This means that SVCALL interrupt processing can defer the high priority interrupt and result in the jitter in that interrupt response.  Fix is to raise the priority of the high priority interrupt above the priority of the SVCALL interrupt.  Suggested by Nathan Hartman.

eda7f5f379	Gregory Nutt	Thu Aug 1 08:09:50 2019 -0600	sched/task/task_exithook.c:  nxtask_signalparent() in task_exithook.c may invalidate the group's parent task ID (tg_ppid) too soon.  The tg_ppid field is use only to remember the parent tasks ID so that it can send the SIGCHLD signal to it.  So it must stay valid until SIGCHLD has been sent.  In nxtask_signalparent(), it calls nxtask_sigchild() to send SIGCHLD to the parent, then invalidates tg_ppid.  That would be okay, except that the SIGCHLD is only sent when the last member of the group terminates. That is incorrect; tg_ppid can be invalidated too soon and, as a consequence, SIGCHLD would never be sent.

361d85ae35	Gregory Nutt	Sat Jul 27 10:26:52 2019 -0600	net/tcp and udp:  Fix errors in the new implementation of SO_LINGER.  The tcp_drain() and udp_drain() functions were casting the working argument to the wrong type, resulting in hangs and abnormal behavior.  There is a complexity in the tcp drain logic when the remote peer closes the socket before all Tx data has been flushed.  Sometimes we are not notified of this case and wait the entire timeout unnecessarily.  There is a workaround in place in tcp_txdrain(), but this really should be revisited.

This is necessary because bt_hci.h content was previously comment out because it uses several compiler specific things include zero-dimensione arrays and uint64_t.  Neither are supported by the C89 ZiLOG ZDS-II compiler.

9b13eaf595	Gregory Nutt	Wed May 8 10:01:37 2019 -0600	arm/src/lpc54xx/:  Bring in the USB FS OHCI driver from LPC17.  This is a quick'n'dirty port that I will finish sometime later (I hope).  Currently, it is missing hardware clocking setup and is not even hooked into the build system yet.  Needless to say it does not yet even compile.

When drawing, NX may report mouse positions outside of the Window.  The is only for NX windows, but the outside-the-side positions were being discarded by nxtk_events().
b05e940135	Gregory Nutt	Tue May 7 08:49:16 2019 -0600	graphics/:  Windows can now be created in the hidden state.  This can be used to clean up initial window presentation which may involve several steps.  This makes those steps all invisible until nx[tk]_setvisibility() is called to make the windows visible.
8cc0d2fc15	Gregory Nutt	Mon May 6 12:04:48 2019 -0600	graphics/nxbe/nxbe_setvisibility.c:  Fix a missed redraw command in last NX visibility changes.

da314276a1	Gregory Nutt	Sun May 5 15:18:31 2019 -0600	NX graphics:  This commit adds support for hiding windows. This features is needed by Twm4Nx:  When a window is iconfied, the icon should appear on the background and the window should disappear (i.e., be hidden).  The windows needs to remain healthy and to be updated in all ways, but it cannot affect the display content.

800f6003a6	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 24 14:08:14 2019 -0600	drivers/can/can.c:  Another fatal build problem from recent commits.  Don't people actually test these things?

0d203fd535	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 24 12:11:40 2019 -0600	drivers/serial:  The upper half serial driver configuration CONFIG_SERIAL_DMA used to enable DMA on both RX and TX streams.  This was replaced with CONFIG_SERIAL_RXDMA and CONFIG_SERIAKL_TXDMA which will permit supporting DMA on only one or both streams.
eef5e777c9	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 21 15:10:56 2019 -0600	include/cxx/cstdlib:  Add std::random()

c999d12bba	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 14 09:37:25 2019 -0600	net/utils:  net_lock() and net_restorelock() not return a value.  That values is the standard zero on success; negated errno value on failure.  This return value is only needed for -ECANCELED.  That cancellation indication needs to ripple all the way back to the highest levels where the cancellation can be acted on.  This commit only adds the return value; it does not add checking for the return values of net_lock() and net_restorelock() at higher levels.  That is required too.
4179b8416f	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 13 16:54:55 2019 -0600	graphics/:  Clean up some C and Kconfig comments.  Remove Kconfig dependency on EXPERIMENTAL.

c4f618e590	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 13 15:08:32 2019 -0600	graphics/nxbe:  This seems to fix the last of software cursor bugs.  On the LPC54, it looks pretty clean.  Not flickery as I feared.  Probably not so good on low end displays.  Possible transient artifacts?  Not sure, maybe.  Or maybe my eyes are playing tricks froom staring at this too long.
de7aedfe96	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 13 11:18:38 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32:  As noted by Matias N, the FLASH base address used was incorrect.  It was using the address of the FLASH data, not the address of the FLASH registers.
099d9f94f4	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 13 10:13:00 2019 -0600	graphics/nxbe:  More work cursor coordinates.  Still at least one big bug in the logic.

e514402c28	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 10 07:27:43 2019 -0600	graphics/nxbe:  Add some missing checks:  Don't permit the software cursor to be enabled until it has been assigned an image; don't perform any cursor operations while the cursor is disabled.
084ad8dd86	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 9 15:50:26 2019 -0600	graphics/Kconfig:  Improve some help text.

0a6bb6e614	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 8 17:14:41 2019 -0600	grahics/nxglib/nxglib.h:  Move internal function prototypes from include/nuttx/nx/nxglib.h to graphics/nxglib/nxglib.h.
9121f44dce	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 8 08:32:33 2019 -0600	graphics/nxbe:  Correct some experimental cursor drawing algorithms.  This logic is experimental and not yet in use.
2c2729521b	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 7 18:00:40 2019 -0600	Abandon attempt to get common data structures for NX and the raw framebuffer cursor interface.  This backs out several changes.

10388e9123	Gregory Nutt	Mon Mar 25 13:48:27 2019 -0600	exmamples/, graphics/NxWidgets:  Implement new interfaces nx_synch() and nxtk_synch().  This are used to syncrhonize the NX server with the window client.  Currently most of the logic is equivalent to nx_block() and nxtk_block(), but with slightly different semantics.  The are separate now because they are likely to diverge in the future.
f5e8dc60f4	Gregory Nutt	Mon Mar 25 13:00:13 2019 -0600	graphics/nxmu, include/nuttx/nx/nxmu.h, libs/libnx:  Add new server->client callback to notify the window client of server events.  Remove the old 'blocked' callback and just make it one case of an 'event' callback.

3e6c196ffa	Gregory Nutt	Mon Mar 25 10:32:43 2019 -0600	arch/ and config/ files:  All board interfaces (those starting with board_) must be defined in board-specific logic.  Otherwise, they cannot be customized of specialized usage by different boards.  The board_reset() interface was defined in architecture-specific logic that only called up_systemreset().  That is useless!

842d3dc4e5	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 20 19:34:23 2019 -0600	Rename sched_alarm_expiration to nxsched_alarm_expiration.  That is the appropriate name for an internal sched/ function (still many named incorrectly).
9acb652e29	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 20 19:31:43 2019 -0600	Rename sched_timer_expiration to nxsched_timer_expiration.  That is the appropriate name for an internal sched/ function (still many named incorrectly).

4fc745fa82	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 20 12:57:44 2019 -0600	configs/stm32f769i-disco/netnsh/defconfig:  Remove CONFIG_STM32F7_QUADSPI=y from the configuration.  This was apparently set before the implementation was added.  Now that the implemenation was added, the configuration will not build because it requires that QSPI GPIO pin definitions be provided in the board.h header file.

372e8b86a4	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 20 12:26:45 2019 -0600	libs/libnx/nxmu/nx_filltrapezoid.c:  Fix a coordinate system error.  When no clipping rectangle is falls, it falls back to use the entire window as for the clip.  However, that window must then then be in window relative coordinates, not in absoute device coordinates.
d7851cf38d	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 20 09:49:26 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32f7/stm32_qspi.c:  Update for new universal cache conrols.

b174373faa	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 20 08:28:34 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_allocateheap.c:  Change 'if CONFIG_STM32_HAVE_CCM' to 'ifdef CONFIG_STM32_HAVE_CCM' to avoid a warning when CONFIG_STM32_HAVE_CCM is not defined.

ba859ad302	Gregory Nutt	Tue Mar 12 14:22:52 2019 -0600	tools/nxstyle.c:  Don't complain about certain lowercase characters in otherwise uppercase pre-processor identifers:  IPv6, IPv4, ICMPv6, IGMPv2, p as a decimal point, d signifying a divisor.  It was a bad idea to let the door open a crack for there.  While they improve readability, the inconsistently also causes other problems.

Basically works until the screen becomes full and it starts scrolling.  Then characters are missing from the display.  Needs more debug and test.

7696731f19	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 6 13:27:50 2019 -0600	configs/open1788/knxterm:  Add a configuration to test NxTerms in the PROTECTED mode.  This configuration does not yet link correctly because a few NxTerms interfaces are improperly exported from the OS:  nxterm_redraw() and nxterm_kbdin().  I am thinking that these might be moved into libc/libnx with a little repartitioning effort.
c21be8856c	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 6 12:45:48 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32h7/stm32_timerisr.c:  Update comments to refernce the errata related to the SysTick clock not being HCLK/8.

0951151c33	Gregory Nutt	Mon Feb 25 18:19:13 2019 -0600	libs/libc/pthread, syscall/, and include/sys/syscall.h:  Support for pthread_mutex_timedlock() was added recently, however no new system call was added for the API make is usable only in the FLAT build. With a pthread_mutex_timedlock() system call, there is no reason for a pthread_mutex_lock() system call since it is now nothing more than an wrapper around pthread_mutex_timedlock(), passing NULL for the time value.  The pthread_mutex_lock() syscall was removed and the pthread_mutex_lock() implemented was moved from /sched/pthread to where it now belows in libs/libc/pthread.
9a5134acac	Gregory Nutt	Sun Feb 24 16:04:48 2019 -0600	sched/pthread/pthread_mutexlock.c: Fix an error in last PR.  The abs_timeout value as not being passed from pthread_mutex_timedlock() to pthread_mutex_take().

3502425221	Gregory Nutt	Sun Feb 24 09:52:18 2019 -0600	drivers/net/tun.c:  Packet buffer size should include the configured GUARD_SIZE.  And, given how the buffers are allocated, the allocation size must be an even number of 16-bit values to preserve alignment.
4d3dd73e57	Gregory Nutt	Sun Feb 24 09:43:30 2019 -0600	drivers/net/tun.c:  Re-order all TUN/TAP driver state data.  Not only was was with wasting memory due to alignement requirements, it was also causing network packet buffers to be improperly aligned causing problems because the network requires 16-bit packet buffer alignment for uint16_t accesses.  This alignment problem was discovered by Alan Carvalho de Assis.
11eb7ef4f8	Gregory Nutt	Sat Feb 23 17:44:34 2019 -0600	Minor fixed to documents and C comments.

533fd0636e	Gregory Nutt	Thu Feb 21 13:53:34 2019 -0600	libs/libc/lib_libvsprintf.c and Kconfig:  Remove CONFIG_LIBC_PRINT_MINIMAL.  The output in that configuration is unsatisfactory and inappropriate for use with NuttX.  For example, the output from many NSH commands become corrupted and useless.  Doesn't belong in this context.
146c398eff	Gregory Nutt	Wed Feb 20 08:40:27 2019 -0600	libs/libc/stdio/lib_libvsprintf.c:  Fix typo:  PRINTF_LEVEL, not PRINT_LEVEL.
05a68d175b	Gregory Nutt	Wed Feb 20 08:00:35 2019 -0600	libs/libc/stdio/Kconfig:  CONFIG_LIBC_NUMBERED_ARGS now depends on EXPERIMENTAL.  Per Johannes: I tested numbered arguments on i.mx rt 1050, and it isn't working.  Only on Linux/MSYS 64bit all relevant data types are size 8 bytes, and therefore my loop through the arg list is working. On 32bit systems, all is 4 bytes except floating point variables which is implicit 8 byte double.
432f487581	Gregory Nutt	Tue Feb 19 14:47:27 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32h7 and stm32l4:  Apply David Sidrane's fix for the STM32F7 to the STM32L4 and STM32H7.  The same change might be appropropriate to STMF0/LO and STM32, but the patch does not apply cleanly.  It would have to be manually checked.
e982488e6c	Gregory Nutt	Tue Feb 19 09:04:04 2019 -0600	include/nuttx/compiler.h:  Important fix for C++ users.  compiler.h was using the value of __STDC_VERSION__ to determine if inline functions are supported or not.  If not then the keyword inline was defined out.  Good for C but bad for C++ because C++ does not defined __STDC_VERSION__ at all.  C++ applications may draw in compiler.h indirectly via other head files and this can result in C++ compiler problems since 'inline' is defined out.  This fix is to ignore the (undefined) __STDC_VERSION__ if __cplusplus is defined.

76a2f6c2a2	Gregory Nutt	Sun Feb 17 12:04:02 2019 -0600	libs/libc/stdio:  This commits makes the nano-printf the defualt logic for the printf family.  The legacy printf is still available via CONFIG_LIBC_PRINT_LEGACY.  This commit also modifies the nano-prinf configure:  The PRINT_LEVEL is not long selectable.  Instead, a not CONFIG_LIBC_PRINT_MINIMAL boolean setting was added and the PRINT_LEVEL is derived from a combination of CONFIG_LIBC_PRINT_MINIMAL, CONFIG_LIBC_FLOATINGPOINT, and CONFIG_LIBC_LONG_LONG.

67b16613ba	Gregory Nutt	Sat Feb 16 18:08:38 2019 -0600	libs/libc/stdio/lib_dtoa.c:  Lots of risky turmoil to get this file closer to the NuttX coding style.  Seems to check out, but still risky.  libs/libc/stdio/lib_libdtoa.c:  A fix for the %g format.  The algorithm will sometimes generate number greater than the precision of type double.  This adds a check if the precision has been exceeded and logic to remove the least significant garbage.

653ff2c34e	Gregory Nutt	Sat Feb 16 12:29:00 2019 -0600	Restore lib_sprintf().  It was removed because I thought was not used.  But I was wrong; there is logic in drivers/syslog that depends on lib_sprintf().
3131195d7a	Gregory Nutt	Sat Feb 16 10:06:57 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/tiva/hardware: Fix a typo in the new CC13xx I2C header files.  Found in build testing.

967dc523bb	Gregory Nutt	Tue Feb 12 19:13:22 2019 -0600	sched/:  Remove the option CONFIG_BOARD_INITTHREAD.  Now, if CONFIG_BOARD_INITIALIZE is selected, then the board_initialize() logic will ALWAYS run on an internal kernel thread.

d05e2da2ce	Gregory Nutt	Mon Feb 4 18:45:09 2019 -0600	include/nuttx/nx/nxmu.h:  This header file coul be lethal; it declared an #error if CONFIG_DISABLE_MQUEUE=y.
193e9af6f6	Gregory Nutt	Mon Feb 4 17:48:30 2019 -0600	include/nuttx/nxmu.h:  Due the name change, the nxmu_start() belongs more appropriately in nxmu.h than nx.h.

641a98a434	Gregory Nutt	Sun Feb 3 15:29:47 2019 -0600	arch/:  The saved return register state is available on the user stack.  Thic commit reorders some logic so that certain, critical registers are preserved in the TCB.  This does not make the logic 100% secure, but does prevent some obvious things.  sched/signal/sig_delivery:  Add a flag to the TCB to indicate that we are in a signal handler.  Use this flag to assure that a there a never attempts to nest signal handling operations on a thread.  This was guaranteed before but when locking of pre-emption during signal delivering was eliminated in a previous commit, there was a remote possibility of an attempt to do nested signal handling.  This flag assures that there is only one signal handled at a time.
71e6793702	Gregory Nutt	Sun Feb 3 14:18:39 2019 -0600	sched/sched:  Rename all internal, static functions from sched_* to nxsched_* to indicate that they are NuttX internal functions.  This is only a start.  Eventually, need to rename all sched_ functions prototyped in sched/sched/sched.h and in include/nuttx with nxsched_.
1b1be1f327	Gregory Nutt	Sun Feb 3 10:39:41 2019 -0600	sched/signal/sig_deliver.c:  Restructure nxsig_deliver() so that the signal handler is not called with the pre-emption disabled (or, at least no with pre-emption disabled by nxsig_deliver() itself).
d8943be51c	Gregory Nutt	Sat Feb 2 16:14:43 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/sam34 and sama5:  Port Anthony Merlino's fix of commit  ee840c74da669d5e12884bc51f79adb43c7c8699 to similar Ethernet drivers for parts in other SAM families.

cf1e0f7976	Gregory Nutt	Fri Feb 1 15:42:11 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/samv7/sam_emac.c:  The logic for determining the number of queues for SAMV71 must be extended.  All SAMv7 parts increase the number of queues from 3 to 6 at revision B, not just the SAMV71.
40b74d1f1c	Gregory Nutt	Fri Feb 1 08:52:34 2019 -0600	sched/wqueue/kwork_notifier.c:  Fix broken assertion introduced in recent commit.  Breaks non-error path.  Suggested by Jussi Kivilinna in Butbucket commit comment.

5bf7890d32	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jan 28 06:08:30 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_allocateheap.c:  Correct some confusion in the memory layout introduced in commit 40d666f4406774c0b8ff47a9572583d840350bf3.  The 'primary ram' may be either the internal SRAM or the external DRAM (in the case where an external bootloader has previously initialized the SDRAM).  The primary ram is laid out as:  .data, .bss, then the IDLE stack allocation.  The global variable g_idlestack is the top of the IDLE stack and also the beginning of memory available for the heap in primary ram.  With this change, a range comparison is used to determin if g_idlestack lies in SRAM or SDRAM.  If so, then the remainder of the memory is available for HEAP usage.
78c8485b0d	Gregory Nutt	Sun Jan 27 17:23:01 2019 -0600	Fix some warnings found in build testing.
732bef73a7	Gregory Nutt	Sun Jan 27 16:42:18 2019 -0600	include/net/if.h:  Fix some macro definitions overlooked in commit d105dc9b5e82a3b8710b44a81f05660410e1f22d.  Also corrects the name of a structure:  mii_ioctl_notify_s vs mii_iotcl_notify_s.
4b9abfa3c2	Gregory Nutt	Sun Jan 27 13:41:44 2019 -0600	Every file that uses serial IOCTLs (TIOC*) must explicity include nuttx/fs/ioctl.h.  This was included previously via sneak path in the now deleted arch/serial.h.
2992660420	Gregory Nutt	Sun Jan 27 13:25:58 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  Fix another newly introduced compilarsion error due to missing inclusion of nuttx/fs/ioctl.h.  I think this is a side-effect of removing arch/serial.h which probably provided a sneak inclusion path for nuttx/fs/ioctl.h.  We will just have to fix them one at a time as they pop-up in build testing.
5b400cdf20	Gregory Nutt	Sun Jan 27 13:21:44 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src:  Fix newly introduced compilarsion errors in two more serial drivers:  lpc17xx and lc8223450.  Not sure why this are not occuring, but including nuttx/fs/ioctl.h.

df64811269	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jan 25 07:21:03 2019 -0600	up_initialize():  As noted by Roland Takacs in Bitbucket issue 141, there is a compilation error for STM32 if CONFIG_NET and CONFIG_NETDEV_LATEINIT are selected.  That was due in part to commit 19e16cb which extended up_netinitialize() with a !defined(CONFIG_NETDEV_LATEINIT) guard but did not add the guard to concrete implementations.  I say "in part" because I don't think that the original intent of commit 19e16cb was to enable an alternative initialization of MCU internal Ethernet support but rather to enable support of external Ethernet devices that may have dependencies on, for example, SPI.  However, this is still a proper fix to avoid the compilation error that can occur with this combination of configuration options.

7bf79759bb	Gregory Nutt	Wed Jan 9 15:39:54 2019 -0600	include/nuttx/compiler.h:  Correct support of C-version-specific features.  Cannot depend on GCC version because -std=c89 may be used on comomand line.  Need instead to use __STDC_VERSION__ to determine if a feature is supported.  Also add conditional support inline, depending on C99.

920bb9dec8	Gregory Nutt	Sun Dec 30 14:45:16 2018 -0600	Commit fd68d74264c breaks all STM32 board configurations that use STM32 USB host.  That is because that commit requires CONFIG_STM_USBHOST to be set to build in USB host support, but did not update the necessary board defconfig files to add that required configuration.
b7c274c1ed	Gregory Nutt	Sun Dec 30 13:09:18 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/tiva/common/lmxx_tm4c_gpioirq.c:  Fix some errors I made in reviewing last patch

However, Those changes used an internal OS interface (sched_self()) which is not available when the the user-space memory manager is built in the PROTECTED or KERNEL builds and resulted in build failures.
a01865ba0b	Gregory Nutt	Sat Dec 29 09:36:10 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/tiva/hardware:  Correct a misconception in  CC13x0, CC13x2, and cc6x2 DDI header files.

ebbfb225f6	Gregory Nutt	Fri Dec 21 09:46:33 2018 -0600	drivers/analog/lmp92001.c: Add support for the TI LMP92001 device.
86508a0e85	Gregory Nutt	Thu Dec 20 12:35:55 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32/chip/stm32_dma_v1.h: Fix error: extra tokens at end of #undef directive [-Werror]

9c5d0003aa	Gregory Nutt	Thu Dec 20 08:33:20 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32f0l0:  Bring in missing RCC file.  Now there are two files implementing stm32_clockonfig().  Yech. ./setenv.sh   Also fixes several compile issues.  The STM32L0 boards now compile and link without error.
db24306435	Gregory Nutt	Tue Dec 18 17:45:46 2018 -0600	arch/assertion logic:  Fix additional places where the test for an IDLE task is incorrect.  It is not invalid in all configurations to check for PID==0.  However, the logic fixed in these places lackes sufficient intelligence to find the right stack for the CPU IDLE thread and could still show the wrong stack.
ec9265aa95	Gregory Nutt	Tue Dec 18 17:35:42 2018 -0600	arch assertions:  Correct duplicated logic from commit dbf01d12b7321d1b48b68d3b69842a853b049376.  Checking for PID == zero is not a valid way to test for the IDLE task in all configurations!  This is only true in the single CPU configuration.  In multiple CPU configurations, there will be a separate IDLE task for each CPU with a different PID.
00b5ba0cf0	Gregory Nutt	Tue Dec 18 07:29:01 2018 -0600	sched/task/task_spawn.c:  Correct description of input parameters to task_spawn_exec().  Noted by: JeongchanKim

5832c150d7	Gregory Nutt	Thu Dec 6 13:33:58 2018 -0600	arch/arc/src:  Remove all driver-specific logic to set the interrupt priority.  There is no good reason to change the interrupt priority unless you just want to debug a difficult problem.  OR is you want to use high priority interrupts.  In that case the specific interrupt priorities will need to be set by board-specific logic.

1ac9558460	Gregory Nutt	Mon Nov 26 11:29:20 2018 -0600	sched/irq and sched/sched:  Measurement of interrupt handler duration used to be available only in Tickless mode since it used the high resolution Tickless timer to measure interrupt time.  This commit adds CONFIG_SCHED_IRQMONITOR_GETTIME which, if enabled, will force the interrupt duration caculation to use the same high-resolution, platform-specific timer as is used with the Critical Section Monitor.  This leads to two improvements:  (1) You can now measure interrupt duration in non-Tickless mode, and (2) in either mode, the interrupt duration and the critical section measures will use the same high-resulotion timer and should, therefore, never be any descripancy due to different clock sources.

d94bd49b78	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 16:23:18 2018 -0600	net/mld:  Fix a typo in conditional compilation.  Clean up return values from mld_ngroups().
9b1025ca1b	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 15:25:16 2018 -0600	net/mld/mld_group.c:  Fixed failure to stop queries.  This turned out to be an uninitialized variable.  I wonder why there was no warning from GCC?
610c187e96	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 14:28:15 2018 -0600	net/procfs/netdev_statistics.c:  Eliminate warning:  array subscript is above array bounds.
002f09f2da	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 12:43:03 2018 -0600	net/mld:  Fix logic error when testing for the case where all members have left.  Still does not work.  The end result is that the query timer no longer stops.  Not when another another querier with a lower IP is present or when all of the members have left.  Basically just can't stop querying under any condition.
bfa8c362c6	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 11:56:37 2018 -0600	net/devif/devif_loopback.c:  Fix warning: implicit declaration of memcmp.
8a3fc26b74	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 11:38:29 2018 -0600	Squashed commit of the following:
f14cf966c9	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 08:03:45 2018 -0600	TODO: Minor clarification.
591b03aa7d	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 07:36:52 2018 -0600	net/mld/mld_query.c:  Eliminate a warning: implicit definitino of memcmp.
1a56229386	Gregory Nutt	Sun Nov 11 07:31:59 2018 -0600	net/mld:  Resolve and issue with sending reports from multiple groups in the same polling cycle.
2b3ec4172d	Gregory Nutt	Sat Nov 10 14:06:46 2018 -0600	arch/: Add 'BOARD_ASSERT_RESET_VALUE' in config/Kconfig and replace reboot status '0' to 'CONFIG_BOARD_ASSERT_RESET_VALUE'.
8cfb376f81	Gregory Nutt	Sat Nov 10 12:13:54 2018 -0600	net/mld:  There is an issue with the general query timer design.  There should be a single instance, not a per-group instance of the timer (ditto for the v1 compatibility timer).  Fall back for now and use the per-group MAX query.
f8d39e2c84	Gregory Nutt	Sat Nov 10 11:41:50 2018 -0600	net/MLD:  The MAS query should be sent on the group multicast address.
854046a931	Gregory Nutt	Sat Nov 10 11:29:02 2018 -0600	    /net/devif/ipv6_input.c:  Correct handling of IPv6 extension headers.  The main confusion was that the payload length in the IPv6 header does not include its extension headers.     net/icmpv6/icmpv6_input.c:  Correct caculation of the ICMPv6 header address     net/mld/mld_query.c:  Correct back test for group found.     net/mld/mld_report.c: Fix host vs. network order problem.     net/mld/mld_send.c: Correct the address used in sending the General Query.  It should be the unspecified address in that case.     net/mld:  Querying workaround.  The MLD implementation does not follow the RFC correct when it is the Querier.  The Querier should use a general query and get query messages from all members of all groups.  This would be driven by a single timer since all groups are queried at once.  Instead, the design currently uses a Multicast Address Specific Query with one timer per group and ignores groups that we are not members of.
b0ba5b69c4	Gregory Nutt	Sat Nov 10 09:43:44 2018 -0600	net/udp/Kconfig: Auto-select CONFIG_WQUEUE_NOTIFIER when CONFIG_UDP_READAHEAD_NOTIFIER is selected.
68a115aed9	Gregory Nutt	Sat Nov 10 07:13:54 2018 -0600	net/icmpv6/icmpv6_autoconfig.c and icmpv6_rnotify.c:  Don't take the network device down when reconfiguring only the IP address from within ICMPv6 logic.  Recommended by Xiang Xiao in order to avoid the long delays of bringing some networks back up.
ae29df7445	Gregory Nutt	Fri Nov 9 17:53:31 2018 -0600	net/devif/ipv6_input.c:  Remove an old, outdated comment.
a583488829	Gregory Nutt	Fri Nov 9 16:26:49 2018 -0600	net/devif/ipv6_input.c:  Fix a logic error when the received IPv6 srcaddr is a multicast address.  Exiting logic only supported UDP multicast.  But MLD and certain other ICMPv6 packets also require acceptance of multicast packets.
8527fcf4c5	Gregory Nutt	Fri Nov 9 16:10:19 2018 -0600	net/icmpv6/icmpv6_input.c:  Fix some ICMPv6 introduced with recent changes.

62e4a41209	Gregory Nutt	Tue Nov 6 14:46:03 2018 -0600	net/mld:  Add reference counting on the group joins.  If there are multiple joins from the same group on this, the don't really leave the group until the matching number of leaves happen.  Also add to hooks for the router case:  Keep track of the number members NOT on this host.  Integrate this with the Leave logic to that the group structure can persist while there no non-local members of the group as well.

efbeac79e8	Gregory Nutt	Wed Oct 31 17:41:41 2018 -0600	configs/imxrt1050-evk/src:  Previous committed implemented atypical SPI-based MMC/SD card support conditioned on CONFIG_MMCSD.  This is, of course, incorrect and interferes with the implementation of correct MMC/SD card support using the correct SDIO-based peripheral.  This commit renames that atypical support to *mmcsd_spi* and conditions using that atypical support on CONFIG_MMCSD_SPI with should then not interfere with the correct MMC/SD suppor that can be conditioned on CONFIG_MMCSD_SDIO.
f5ed6bf672	Gregory Nutt	Wed Oct 31 17:15:23 2018 -0600	net/inet/ipv4_setsockopt.c:  Add implementation for all IPv4 socket options that have implemented IOCTL command counterparts.

This is build framework only (not actual socket options are yet handled).  Handling of these socket options is a necessary step on the way to future ICMPv6 MLD support.
6d93658ff8	Gregory Nutt	Wed Oct 31 15:03:51 2018 -0600	Add new configuratin CONFIG_NET_MCASTGROUP.  This option is selected automatically if either CONFIG_NET_IGMP or CONFIG_NET_MLD are selected.  Most conditional logic based on CONFIG_NET_IGMP replaced with conditioning on CONFIG_NET_MCASTGROUP.
dde1e89b8c	Gregory Nutt	Wed Oct 31 14:10:19 2018 -0600	net/mld:  Add basic build structure for Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD).  No real MLD logic yet.  Only a few hooks to capture and dispatch MLD ICMPv6 packets.

7d2b250cbc	Gregory Nutt	Mon Oct 29 12:20:44 2018 -0600	net/netdev:  All utility functions that lookup network devices should begin with netdev_findby_.  Also correct some comments and the name of a formal parameter.
9f754ed1dc	Gregory Nutt	Mon Oct 29 06:50:47 2018 -0600	include/sys/sockio.h, net/netdev/netdev_ioctl.c:  Fix a compile error introducted with commit 34db6d14338c2ecb1a87bf788158ff84c4306c09.  That commit added the semi-standard ip_msfilter structure to netinet/in.h.  Howver, there was a non-standard version of that structure in sys/sockio.h.  This commit removes the non-standard version of struct ip_msfilter and adapts the IOCTL and device lookup logic in net/netdev to work with the new, semi-standard version in netinet/in.h.

d8bfb4e3a2	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 29 11:01:46 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Fix some disagreement between the NuttX wrapper and the core SPIFFS with regard to meaning of a return value.  This was causing more writes than necessary and wasting FLASH space.
5fad655982	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 28 20:05:42 2018 -0600	configs/sim/spiffs/defconfig: Remove CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.
6a12213fbb	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 28 17:35:25 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  I have been test with apps/examples/fstest which provides a good exercise but of the FS internals but not of the user interface.  I build an SPIFFS aware NSH configuration and found and fixed a number of glaring usability errors:  (1) Missing logic to stat the SPIFFS root directory, (2) Confusion in use to two similarly named struct field... caused files to be unexpectedly deleted.  (3) Fixed a sempahore deadlock condition. And (5) Fix /procfs/mount.  It was unaware of the SPIFFS file system type.
e90723307e	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 28 13:21:44 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs: Fix an error in who the deferred 'unlink' is handling in close().  Modify read() and write behavior() so that they do not return so many partial reads and writes.
294456fa20	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 28 11:23:42 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Add logic to dump the logical context of the FLASH.

2d2dd5e9e3	Gregory Nutt	Thu Sep 27 14:24:46 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Fix bad check for return value.  In NuttX all values greater than or equeal to 0 are successes.
1273f727c0	Gregory Nutt	Thu Sep 27 12:25:23 2018 -0600	File System IOCTLs:  Three new IOCTLS were added for SPIFFS, two of which were duplicates.
65ef3acf70	Gregory Nutt	Thu Sep 27 11:33:09 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Still uses some internal error codes that should be replaced with errors from errno.h.  For now, I just added a mapping function before any value is returned to the caller:  And of these detailed internal errors are simply mapped to -EFTYPE.  Most are related to improper internal data structures so -ETYPE is possibly appropriate.  Aslo SPIFFs is no longer is EXPERIMENTAL.  Many things work but I the code is very immature and many things will not work.
554745946d	Gregory Nutt	Thu Sep 27 09:35:58 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  The MTD interfaces needs its own, dedicated page buffer for read-modify-write operations.  It cannot share the normal 'working' page buffer because it is sometimes in-use when the MTD interface needs it.  Also and more DEBUG output and controls for the MTD interface.
7a2f70495a	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 26 20:00:25 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Fix yet another interface with NuttX MTD.  This time, the calculation of the number of whole blocks.
5cc68ad3b8	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 26 18:30:46 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Fix yet another interface with NuttX MTD.  This time, the calculatio of the terminal block number.
b4488a0549	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 26 18:00:46 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Fix an error in write operation.  examples/fstest now gets further before errors occur, but still does not work correctly.
31e6fb561b	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 26 15:50:55 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Costmetic name changes more more consistency.
d59893a456	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 26 15:16:38 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Fixes yet another SPIFFS/MTD interfacing bug.

6d2cce99e1	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 26 10:05:43 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Fix more problems found in testing.  It is getting closer but examples/fstest is still showing problem.
3b1cc69d68	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 26 06:57:49 2018 -0600	include/nutt:  Fix definitions used to access OS functions within the libraries.  In the FLAT build, we must always set the errno and/or create cancellation points because the same library functions are used within the OS as are used by applications.  This could cause issues for the OS but corrects some problems at the user interface.
71eac2d530	Gregory Nutt	Tue Sep 25 18:05:45 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Correct the MTD block write logic.
9984e209ab	Gregory Nutt	Tue Sep 25 16:18:37 2018 -0600	fs/spiffs:  Various fixes from initial testing.  Still lots of issues.  Also changes from further review to get better naming consistency and functional partitioning.

ec498d2660	Gregory Nutt	Mon Sep 24 18:05:09 2018 -0600	This commit brings in an inital port of the SPIFFS flash file system into NuttX.  The file system is still untested at this point (and subject to some additional review).  It is, however, marked EXPERIMENTAL should this should not cause a problem for anyone.
0939fd479f	Gregory Nutt	Mon Sep 24 14:58:49 2018 -0600	include/sys/socket.h:  Renumber the socket types.  They must begin at 1, not zero. Socket type zero has a special meaning for some interfaces.  For example, getaddrinfo() uses a socket type of zero to many any type of socket.  The is no standard name for the any-type-socket, but macOS uses SOCK_UNSPEC.  NuttX will do the same.  Issue noted by Anthony Merlino.
91410573ef	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 22 14:39:11 2018 -0600	fs/mount/fs_mount.c:  Correct an error introduced in the last commit (but only when file systems that need MTD drivers are included.

dec7ecbd56	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 22 09:33:05 2018 -0600	net/tcp/tcp_recvwindow.c:  In order to receive data we must not only have IOBs available, but we must also have at least one IOB chain qentry available.  Otherwise, we will advertise that we an buffer a lot of data when, in fact, we cannot.  This is an expermental fix to a performance problem noted by Masayuki Ishikawa.
510b0f7e07	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 21 21:32:50 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src:  Correct all ARMv7-M architectures.  Interrupts were not be disabled correctly on power up.  Writing zero to the NVIC SET-ENABLE registers has no effect.  In order to disable interrupts, it is necessary to write all ones to the NVIC CLEAR-ENABLE register.  Noted by David Sidrane.

a680553f35	Gregory Nutt	Tue Sep 11 12:00:42 2018 -0600	net/tcp/tcp_netpoll.c:  Add logic to receive notifications when IOBs are freed (Needs CONFIG_NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS and CONFIG_IOB_NOTIFIER).  At present, does nothing because the logic in in psock_tcp_cansend() does not check for the availability of IOBs.  That will change.

9d3148406c	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 9 15:01:44 2018 -0600	Signals were not a good choice of IPC to implement the poll function for several reasons:  In order to handle the asynchrnous poll-related event, a substantial amount of state information is needed.  Signals are only capable of passing minimal amounts of data.  There are also complexities with performing kernel space signal handlers in kernel space code that is better to avoid.  So, instead of signals, the equivalent logic was converted to run via a callback that executes on the high-priority work queue.
20814acad2	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 9 11:57:25 2018 -0600	sched/signal:  In signal notification facility, use sigqueue() to notify vs. kill().  With sigqueue, we can pass more info (but still not enough).
32e3e51678	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 9 10:39:25 2018 -0600	net/netdev:  Add signal notification for the case where the network goes down.
28f73bd928	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 9 09:21:39 2018 -0600	net/tcp and udp:  Add logic to signal events when TCP or UDP read-ahead data is buffered.
fc127fd297	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 9 08:32:37 2018 -0600	sched/signal:  Add a generic signal notification facility.  Modify the custom IOB available notifier so that it is now just a wrapper around this generic signal notification.   This generic signal notification faility will, eventually, be used to support network polling.
0eb1beee63	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 8 17:46:57 2018 -0600	mm/iob:  Improve the IOB notifier data structures.  Replace the fixed array with a singly linked list.  For small value of CONFIG_IOB_NWAITERS, either solution is fine.  But the fixed array does not scale well when CONFIG_IOB_NWAITERS is large.
5bd0f596fc	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 8 16:53:12 2018 -0600	Fix some trivial typos.
bba8541ad6	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 8 11:21:18 2018 -0600	mm/iob:  Add an IOB notifier that will send a signal to any registered threads that want to be notified when an IOB has been freed.  This is an untested work-in-progress and is intended to be a part of a larger solution to correctly handling network poll operations.
ddaea5dabc	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 8 08:28:02 2018 -0600	Revise commit cce9ae94f4cb231575dcb61e87f5a09fb673795f:  The pass1/ directly only needs to be added to the directories to be cleaned.  That would be OTHERDIRS vs. NONFSFIRS.  Also remove old reference to the defunct lib directory (now the staging directory).
cce9ae94f4	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 8 08:11:38 2018 -0600	tools/Directories.mk:  The pass1 directory was not being cleaned on 'make distclean'
9479ad54f9	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 8 06:56:01 2018 -0600	Update of Documents/NuttX.html in preparation for the 7.26 release.
fa5822f255	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 7 15:35:45 2018 -0600	Partial update of Documents/NuttX.html in preparation for the 7.26 release.  There is still more to be done.

cbb9223f4e	Gregory Nutt	Thu Sep 6 12:03:41 2018 -0600	Update ChangeLog in preparation for 7.26 release.
891b2646da	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 5 14:56:09 2018 -0600	configs/:  apps/netutils/ping has been removed.  Ping support is now provided by apps/system/ping.  Remove references to -CONFIG_NETUTILS_PING or change them to CONFIG_SYSTEM_PING with CONFIG_NET_ICMP_SOCKET=y
33e3fb7a70	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 5 11:56:14 2018 -0600	Correct mispellings of pseudo.  Update some comments in signal.h.
b7d1f13a54	Gregory Nutt	Wed Sep 5 06:45:49 2018 -0600	b/sched/sched/sched_waitpid.c:  Remove options check in DEBUG_FEATURES

ab5ebc5498	Gregory Nutt	Mon Sep 3 16:27:54 2018 -0600	Revert "tools/KernelLibs.mk:  Force libproxies to be built and installed before applications are build.  Otherwise, the applications will not be able to find libproxies.  I don't know why this was never seen before.  Must be due to recent changes in the apps/ directory.  The change is correct in any event."
f7eee58aee	Gregory Nutt	Mon Sep 3 13:34:41 2018 -0600	tools/KernelLibs.mk:  Force libproxies to be built and installed before applications are build.  Otherwise, the applications will not be able to find libproxies.  I don't know why this was never seen before.  Must be due to recent changes in the apps/ directory.  The change is correct in any event.
152ccbd447	Gregory Nutt	Mon Sep 3 09:42:04 2018 -0600	configs/olimex-stm32-p407/dhtxx:  Fix defconfig file.  It was based on an older, incompatible version of NuttX.
993321dda6	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 2 15:36:25 2018 -0600	drivers/serial:  Add support for Ctrl-Z.  This works just like the recently added Ctrl-C support except that SIGSTP is sent when the Ctrl-Z characters is encountered vs. SIGINT.
093348030e	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 2 13:51:52 2018 -0600	sched/: Update signal default STOP action.  If waitpid was called with the WUNTRACED then wake up waitpid.  Also fix some compile problems.. How did this work before?
a6f9c6215d	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 2 12:34:45 2018 -0600	Update some comments
5c5b6ab8f6	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 2 08:35:22 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32h7:  Remove old references to RXDMA.  Add configuration option to select the Rx FIFO threshold level.
ff1e6a66e9	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 2 07:31:16 2018 -0600	configs/metro-m4:  Fix problem with SysTick timer running too fast.  This turned out to be a dumb typo in board.h that was providing the wrong CPU frequency to the SysTick setup logic.
9f6383e5fd	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 1 17:03:31 2018 -0600	configs/metro-m4:  Verify the CMCC and enable it by default in the NSH configuration.
f66869b793	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 1 15:58:24 2018 -0600	configs/metro-m4: Update the NSH configuration.
aee1c39eab	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 1 15:29:08 2018 -0600	configs/metro-m4:  Fix RxD interrupt pin selection.  The number SERCOM interrupts do not refer to PAD numbers, but to bit positions in the INFLAG register (very tiny footnote in the data sheet).  With with final fix, the basic NSH configuration appears fully functional.
6ada0e10ba	Gregory Nutt	Sat Sep 1 14:38:19 2018 -0600	configs/metro-m4:  Fix RxD PAD selection.  Add a configuration option to use OSCULP32K instead of XOSC32K.

25dce66483	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 31 13:34:09 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/samd5e5/:  Combine some duplicated GCLK configuration logic
ff906b0bef	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 31 09:58:53 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/samd5e5:  Updates to clock configuration from initial testing.  With these changes the boot up gets through clock configuration but hangs in the low-level USART configuration before completing the boot.
345d088661	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 31 07:38:52 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/samd5e5:  Updates to clock configuration from initial testing.  Still does not boot correctly.

1d04ef2f93	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 29 14:55:45 2018 -0600	sched/signal/sig_default.c:  Lock the scheduler while while killing the children so that we do not lose priority and let the task group continue to run in an indeterminate state.
94910d2925	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 29 13:09:00 2018 -0600	sched/: Cosmetic reordering of conditional compilation. Style is that comments related to the conditionally compiled logic are included within the conditional compipilation so that its scope and belongingness is clear.
bb92b98dc0	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 29 10:51:44 2018 -0600	net/arp/arp_out.c:  Fix some backward logic in an if condition.
d24f58c790	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 29 07:33:28 2018 -0600	sched/group/group_killchildren.c:  In some circumstances, group_killchildren() could have called pthread_cancel() to kill a task.  Also, the behavior would not be as expected if a pthread had cancellation disabled.  sched/signal/sig_default.c:  Correct signal handling in the multiple threaded case.  The SIGKILL signal may actually be processed on a pthread, not the main thread of the task.
73c73af777	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 29 07:13:21 2018 -0600	sched/irq/irq_dispatch.c:  Fix my typo that was added while reviewing Xiang's changne.

dcb3d4b050	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 28 12:39:03 2018 -0600	sched/signal:  Add logic and an interface to determin if a signal can be caught or ignored.  sigaction now correctly returns EINVAL on any attempt to catch or ignore such signals (only SIGKILL for now and only if CONFIG_SIG_DEFAULT=y).
0756cf66ed	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 28 12:15:31 2018 -0600	sched/signal:  Add support for SIGINT in addition to SIGKILL.  drivers/serial:  Use SIGINT instead of SIGKILL when control-C is pressed.
0b60bbc6d3	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 28 10:51:34 2018 -0600	Update some Kconfig comments.
e7ce9bbfc4	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 28 09:15:29 2018 -0600	drivers/serial:  Integrate new Ctrl-C logic with the ISIG flag in the termios c_lflag.  Fix several compiler errors resulting from recently flurry of renaming.

00c6793e61	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 27 16:13:07 2018 -0600	drivers/power/pm_register.c: Fix an error found in build testing.
499b89feed	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 27 15:37:43 2018 -0600	sched/signal: Default Signal Actions.  Change some types to superficially simplify.  Add configuration options to enabled default signal behaviors on a per-signal basis.  I don't think users are prepared for SIGALRM to terminate the task (which is the correct default behavior if you don't change it).  Extend the implementation of default signals so that it is totally table driven and extensible by simply mondifying the content of const tables.
6d094e4b33	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 27 13:13:23 2018 -0600	sched/signals:  Update the signal default action logic to support sigaction().  signaction() must be able to handle and input action of SIG_DFL to setup the default signal action; it mast also return SIG_DFL it is replacing the default action.

9774d35010	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 24 17:36:08 2018 -0600	net/arp:  Make the function arp_find() thread-safe.  It now returns a copy of the ARP table entry, rather than a potentially unstable reference to the ARP table entry.
e8270defc9	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 24 16:40:37 2018 -0600	arch/:  Fix an error found in build testing.  The protoype of mpu_log2regionfloor() changed; an additional parameter was added.  However, none of the calls to mpu_log2regionfloor() were updated to pass the new, additional parameter.

e3a1d4213c	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 22 08:30:36 2018 -0600	configs:  Several applications in apps/ were callign elf_initialize() nxflat_initialize(), or builtin_initialize() in violation of the portable POSIX interface.  Those calls were removed from the applications and added to the appropriate board initialization with this commit.
b56d5a7548	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 22 07:29:55 2018 -0600	Revert "sched/init:  Add option to mount block device for INIT_FILEPATH case"

e17d8c719e	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 20 19:06:52 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32f7/stm32_serial.c:  Previous logic would invalidate the data cache as each byte was read from the DMA buffer.  This change moves one line of code:  The cache invalidation moved from the single character read logic to the DMA complete interrupt handler.  It is only necessary to invalidate the DMA buffer at the time that the Rx DMA completes.
10f74ebd3f	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 19 18:07:10 2018 -0600	configs/:  Refresh AVR, AVR32, MIPS/PIC32, and Simulator configurations.
47d87fd857	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 19 17:48:13 2018 -0600	configs/:  Refresh ARM and Xtensa configurations.
92b925ba02	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 19 15:38:06 2018 -0600	arch/Kconfig:  Bring-up features should also depend on CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES.  I missed a bring-up feature that is specific to the ESP32.  I hope that the ESP32 ports still work as intended!  It depended on some of these bring-up settings in the header file.  I moved the definitions to the ESP32 defconfig files.
cba0ddad0e	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 19 14:55:49 2018 -0600	arch/:  Most some common debug configuration settings out of header files and into Kconfig files where they belong.
8e203e09d4	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 19 11:19:43 2018 -0600	Costmetic changes
c790450ba2	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 19 10:06:36 2018 -0600	Remove CONFIG_ARCH_CALIBRATION.  It is awkward to use and no longer necessary now that we have apps/examples/calib_udelay.
f20a2b4dcd	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 19 08:24:30 2018 -0600	include/sys/param.h:  Add a dummy sys/param.h header file.  This is not a standard file but is used by other systems and having the dummy file may minimize some porting efforts.
ed4aae0fe0	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 19 07:44:04 2018 -0600	include/endian.h and libs/libc/endian:  Add support for endian.h.

f980200ac4	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 18 18:00:23 2018 -0600	fs/procfs/:  Add support for /proc, a convenient way for getting information about the currently running task.
bbad69ab61	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 18 09:14:59 2018 -0600	Change all occurrences of CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NSH* to CONFIG_SYSTEM_NSH* to match changes in the apps/ directory.
0e5b02552a	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 17 16:06:01 2018 -0600	inclued/stdio.h:  popen()/pclose() are not available in KERNEL mode because they depend on task_spawn() which is not available in KERNEL mode.
5a23ca37b1	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 17 14:23:38 2018 -0600	Cosmetic update to comments.
4dac881e24	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 17 10:40:59 2018 -0600	include/stdio.h:  Add prototypes for popen() and pclose().  Actual implementation is in apps/system/popen()
a9b1940c95	Gregory Nutt	Thu Aug 16 10:46:44 2018 -0600	Documentation/NuttX.html: Add note about CDC/ECM
aeda17318d	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 15 18:45:39 2018 -0600	tools/Config.mk:  Move the RWILDCARD function definition from apps/builtin/Makefile to nuttx/tools/Config.mk.  It may have a broader usage than it does now.
96f05c895d	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 15 18:30:12 2018 -0600	tools/Config.mk:  Add function CATFILE definition.  Currently only used in apps/builtin/Makefile.
4b92f71a82	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 14 13:54:10 2018 -0600	net/netdev/netdev_register.c:  Eliminate a newly introduced warning.
b00a2e5c54	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 14 08:40:06 2018 -0600	net/:  Change order of logic:  Select the user-defined interface name format BEFORE determining the minor device number.  Otherwise, the devault interface name will be used.
4a724b1f3c	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 14 08:01:52 2018 -0600	net/:  Remove all references to CONFIG_NET_USER_DEVFMT.  That feature is now unconditionally enabled.  This was done because (1) the feature does not require very much additional memory, and (2) it causes confusion in the configuration due to the additional complexity.  And network drivers that fail to zero the device structure interface name field (d_ifname) because calling netdev_register() will, however, get a nasty surprise.
ef3abe1423	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 13 15:53:15 2018 -0600	Add missing function names in function headers.

25fa50d504	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 10 10:16:39 2018 -0600	fs/proc and sched/environ:  Add support for a procfs entry that will permit examining the environment of any task.
672c6a5405	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 10 09:22:27 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/kinetis:  Remove annoying typedefs.  Discouraged but not prohibited by coding standard
0bc84d74b6	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 10 08:10:35 2018 -0600	configs/freedom-k66f/nsh/defconfig:  Disable DMA in this configuration.

3973640fff	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 8 17:06:46 2018 -0600	Update some comments.  Remove references to non-existent CONFIG_MAX_TASK_ARG.
5433c9f6d1	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 8 12:51:40 2018 -0600	Revert "arch/arm/src/stm32, stm32f7, stm32l4 Kconfig files:  The option to select the STM32 RTC should not be available if the external RTC option is selected."
714e8c1f9e	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 8 12:49:01 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32, stm32f7, stm32l4 Kconfig files:  The option to select the STM32 RTC should not be available if the external RTC option is selected.
8d68d9ca43	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 8 12:42:04 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32, stm32f7, stm32l4, and related defconfig files:  The STM32 RTC driver was being selected by the global CONFIG_RTC option.  That is in correct.  For example, if you want to disabled the STM32 RTC and use an external RTC you cannot because the external RTC also depends on the global CONFIG_RTC.  The solution is to add a new CONFIG_STM32xx_RTC configuration option the permits to you select or deselect the STM32 RTC but still be able to selecte the external RTC.
a876f58a10	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 7 17:53:16 2018 -0600	Update a README file.
a2428db499	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 7 10:50:25 2018 -0600	configs/olimex-stm32_p407:  Add logic to support initialization of the kernel module symbol table installed in the pass2/ directory during the application phase of the build.  The kmodule configuration appears to be fully functional.
4becaea8e3	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 7 08:30:17 2018 -0600	This commit extends support for the two-pass build.  Its primary purpose is to incorporate source logic generated by applications into the kernel phase of the build.
4e5cf1229c	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 5 17:58:17 2018 -0600	drivers/mmcsd/Kconfig: three configuration settings were within ifdef/endif and led to warning: xxx selects xxxx which has unmet direct dependencies.  Fix by moving settings to drivers/Kconfig and outside of the ifdef-endif.  Also renamed CONFIG_SDIO_PREFLIGHT to CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_SDIO_PREFLIGHT to follow naming of similar hidden architecture capability configurations.
c6adc4ba8e	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 5 16:23:07 2018 -0600	sched/pthread/pthread_initialize.c:  Fix a warning found in build testing (that is actually and bug and would cause an incorrect value to be returned in many cases.
9726352d7a	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 5 15:41:51 2018 -0600	configs/olimex-stm32-p407/kmodule:  Add a configuration that can be used for testing installation of kernel modules in the protected build.  This configuration is useless in its present state, not due to any problem with the OS itself, but rather with the current apps/ build system.  The symbol table is built by apps/examples/module/drivers/Makefile in user space.  The problem with that is that the kernel module does reference internal kernel symbols which are not available in the user space build context.  A mechanism is needed in the build system to build the symbol table in the context of the kernel.  There is currently no way to do that.
e79772f6d8	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 5 15:34:25 2018 -0600	tools/showsize.sh needs to be executable.
c2267a57a0	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 5 10:48:02 2018 -0600	Kconfig files:  Fix several errors noted by Alex Denisov in Bitbucket issue 115.
b4b531ef1b	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 5 08:50:43 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/binfmt/binfmt.h:  Remove fields from struct binary_s that are not longer used after commit 20a86dfc1b761c596c45f1783cb1a125a609dc08.
4fa546c5d8	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 5 08:41:32 2018 -0600	Refresh a configuration:  Fix an assertion that was messed up in the previous commit.
20a86dfc1b	Gregory Nutt	Sun Aug 5 08:09:54 2018 -0600	binfmt/ and sched/group:  Re-architect the way that loadable ELF or NXFLAT modules are unloaded.  Memory resources must be recovered when the task loaded into memory exits.  The originmal implementatino used the death-of-child SIGCHLD signal to perform the unload.  There are several problems with this:  It is overly complex, it requires that the parent task stay resident while the loaded task runs, and it has fatal logic flaws in the protected and kernel model builds because the user signal handler attempts to run in the kernel address space.  This commit corrects with using a mindlessly simply BINFMT callback when the task exits.

That may be what we want in most cases, but certainly not all.  This does increse the size of the inline function by about 48-bits per instantiation.
679d2875f2	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 3 16:20:42 2018 -0600	Update some comments.
9b7e5ede0a	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 3 15:26:44 2018 -0600	configs/metro-m4:  Add an option to build the Metro M4 image to run out of SRAM.  This ought to be a safer and quicker way to do the initial bring-up (having bricked the first Metro M4 due to a bad FLASH image).
bbee0d70de	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 3 14:26:29 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32f7:  Fix an error introduced by the patch by Evgeniy Bobkov in Issue #114.  That patch brok all STM32 F7 builds.
056d704cf9	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 3 13:22:36 2018 -0600	This commit brings in a fragmentary, experimental implementation of NETLINK sockets.  There is not too much to that socket support on this initial commit, just the netlink socketer framework.  However, I decided to bring it into master because there is a enough that I would not want to lose what is in place.  And since it is dependent on CONFIG_EXPERIMENATL, its presence on master should be innocuous.
bfc8f9dfdb	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 3 10:53:37 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt/imxrt_enet.c:  Fix a warning about imxrt_calcethcrc() being defined, but not used.

ee28cd9aeb	Gregory Nutt	Fri Aug 3 07:43:57 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/i2c/i2c_master.h:  Add a definition to distinguish a new START of messages from a repeated start.

a3f80e1894	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jul 16 12:15:09 2018 -0600	binfmt/binfmt_execsymtab.c:  Fix a typo in a configuration variable name.
4d648625e3	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jul 16 09:50:10 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32fy:  IO compensation is non longer an inline function, just a plain callable function.  Not really necessary for the F7, but now the implementation is identical to the F2 and F4.
871bface28	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jul 16 09:05:53 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32:  Use of inline function for I/O compensation causes too many issues.  No just a plain callable function.

These are very nicely written drivers, but they are based on some external sequencer logic which is not available to everyone.  Hence, these are inapropriate to carry in the NuttX repository.

Actually ALL network configuration should be modified to use the low priority work queue.  It is inappropriate to be performing network operations on the high priority work queue.
427b3b8fcb	Gregory Nutt	Sat Jul 7 08:26:13 2018 -0600	Squashed commit of the following:
75cc19ebb4	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jul 6 19:49:05 2018 -0600	net/tcp: Fix a deadlock condition that can occur when (1) all network logic runs on a single work queue, (1) TCP write buffering is enabled, and (2) we run out of IOBs.  In this case, the TCP write buffering logic was blocking on iob_alloc() with the network locked.  Since the network was locked, the device driver polls that would provide take the write buffer data and release the IOBs could not execute.  This fixes the problem by unlocking the network lock while waiting for the IOBs.

5764d5a529	Gregory Nutt	Thu Jul 5 17:41:01 2018 -0600	net/tcp:  Back out part of commit d9443888881e5d638a08ab3f6fdc203c9f9f475c.  I see a few places that say that the maximum receive window size is 32,767 (INT16_MAX), but most say that it is 65,535 (UINT16_MAX).
d944388888	Gregory Nutt	Thu Jul 5 16:08:03 2018 -0600	configs/viewtool-stm32f107:  Add a TCP performance test using apps/examples/tcpblaster.

22cd0d47fa	Gregory Nutt	Wed Jul 4 14:10:40 2018 -0600	This commit attempts remove some long standard confusion in naming and some actual problems that result from the naming confusion.  The basic problem is the standard MTU does not include the size of the Ethernet header.  For clarity, I changed the naming of most things called MTU to PKTSIZE.  For example, CONFIG_NET_ETH_MTU is now CONFIG_NET_ETH_PKTSIZE.
daa3fcc781	Gregory Nutt	Wed Jul 4 08:55:43 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/spi/spi.h:  Add a definition for a USBHOST SPI device.  drivers/usbhost/usbhost_max3421e.c:  Review and correct SPI locking usage.
254924029b	Gregory Nutt	Wed Jul 4 07:35:51 2018 -0600	net/udp:  Restore some legacy behavior that was lost with the implementation of CONFIG_NET_UDP_BINDTODEVICE:  If no device has a local address when the broadcast packet is sent and the UDP socket is not bound to a device, there select some arbitrary device.  This is certainly lunacy in the case where there are multiple network devices registered because the wrong device will probably be returned.  It works find, however, for the legacy case where only a single network device is registered.

Remove more inline tests for IPv6 multicast with tcommint net_is_addr_mcast() macro.  Update some comments.
5bb216fb90	Gregory Nutt	Sat Jun 23 10:13:38 2018 -0600	net/:  There are many different checks for IPv6 multicast addresses.  Most of the checks are different.  RFC 3513 clearly specifies how to detect an IPv6 multilcast address:  they should begin with 0xffxx.  I did not change some of the checks in ipv6_input.c, however.  In that file, the comments indicate that the code should only pick of certain mulicast address that begin withi 0xff02.

Yes the architecture provides support for the old-style dedicated vector handling which can never be compiled.  Furthermore, the old-style dedicated vector handling is deprecated in favor of common vector handling.  The commit resolves this inconsistency be removing support for the dedicated vector handling from the EFM32 architecture support.

If debug output is desired for debugging purposes, then these release configurations can simply be changes to debug configurations be simply re-enabling the debug options.

It has been replaced with the equivalent, standard interface clock() as the system call. sched/clock:  Move the implementation of clock() from libs/libc/time to sched/clock.

Basically they should only differ in the configuratin naming:  CONFIG_STM32F7_ vs CONFIG_STM32_.  I suspect that the STM32F7 may also require some cache operations with the WRITE_BACK data cache is enabled.
6dcce0430c	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jun 15 13:13:12 2018 -0600	This change ports in Marco Krahl's STM32F4 framebuffer overlays for the LTDC and DMA2D into the STM32F7.  That driver was same as the STM32F4 driver.  I am unable to verify the update because I do not have the STM32F76x hardware.  So this commit very likely breaks the LTDC/DMA2D.  However, it was probably not left in a functional state anyway so I do not think that there is any loss.

20f1597fa5	Gregory Nutt	Sun May 20 12:02:50 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  IOMUXC logic now uses peripheral clock helpers (I think it was enabling the wrong clocks anyway).  Minor updates to eDMA logic.
9c9c0eb4d5	Gregory Nutt	Sun May 20 10:59:36 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  Add eDMA interrupt decode logic.
87df439909	Gregory Nutt	Sun May 20 10:34:27 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  Add eDMA initialization logic.
0f6aeb7cff	Gregory Nutt	Sun May 20 10:03:45 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt: Centralilze and standardize control of peripheral clocking.  Add logic to initialize the DMAMUX.
6529a5666e	Gregory Nutt	Sat May 19 17:32:56 2018 -0600	Update README file
9da3d4a2a9	Gregory Nutt	Sat May 19 16:46:21 2018 -0600	drivers/lcd and configs/olimex-lpc1766stk:  Remove support for the Nokia6100 LCD.  That LCD uses a 9-bit SPI interface (the 9th bit being the command/data bit that is normally a discrete).  That communication was never successfully integrated.  I now believe that it would would require some special support from the low-level, MCU SPI driver to manage that 9th bit.  The deleted code is still available in the Obsoleted repository in the nuttx/drivers/lcd, nuttx/configs/olimex-lpc1766stk, and Patches directories.
2366c13f87	Gregory Nutt	Fri May 18 13:36:58 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/fb.h:  Fix a type _BEND -> _BLEND

c84342d357	Gregory Nutt	Fri May 18 08:21:08 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/video/fb.h:  No, I was right the first time.  sys/types.h is needed in some inclusion contexts.
d813c867aa	Gregory Nutt	Fri May 18 08:03:48 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/fb:  Last change was wrong.  It was not a missing header.  It was just a dumb typo.
eaa1570fba	Gregory Nutt	Fri May 18 07:50:10 2018 -0600	include/video/fb.h:  Use of size_t requires inclusion of sys/types.h
8b0b7636a8	Gregory Nutt	Fri May 18 07:24:36 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/video/fb.h:  Make type used for overlay number consistent; Use standardized types (size_t and fb_coord_t) whenever possible.
af8b1abf73	Gregory Nutt	Thu May 17 16:11:09 2018 -0600	Merged fboverlay into master
fe364ba1f4	Gregory Nutt	Thu May 17 14:23:58 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  A little more eDMA logic.  Slow progress.
1acc765156	Gregory Nutt	Thu May 17 09:48:45 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  A little more DMA-related logic.  Still no significant logic in place.
a186383f2a	Gregory Nutt	Thu May 17 07:46:09 2018 -0600	Recent changes to UDP in order to correct problems with UDP connection mode introduced a new bug:  The 'to' address passed to sendto() must now be NULL in connection mode.  But there are errors because there was one place where the 'to' address was still being used.
f91c3666a1	Gregory Nutt	Wed May 16 16:20:30 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  A little more DMA logic.  Still far from complete.
ea8d78c9c5	Gregory Nutt	Wed May 16 14:28:22 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  Add framework for eDMA support.  Initial port is a rip off from the SAMA5Dx and is little more than the framework for the DMA support.
9bb4a80838	Gregory Nutt	Wed May 16 12:35:10 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt/chip:  Remove un-necessary TCD structure.

c681519720	Gregory Nutt	Tue May 15 07:49:50 2018 -0600	 arch/arm/src/imxrt/imxrt_serial.c:  Fix some interrupt instabilities; must be in a critical section when modifying serial interrupts.  configs/imxrt1050-evk/nsh/defconfig:  Use the BASEPRI register to enable/disable interrupts; enable the PROCFS file system.
2c94eb1188	Gregory Nutt	Tue May 15 04:24:26 2018 +0000	board.h edited online with Bitbucket

4a9a421c34	Gregory Nutt	Fri May 11 06:26:01 2018 -0600	Back out part of f4bcaa4fc2dc2f06d5632d3b74f43c25a6e7e845.If CONFIG_ARCH_IDLE_CUSTOM is defined, then it should not use the version of lc823450_idle.c in arch/arm/src/lc823450. That part was correct before the PR. If CONFIG_ARCH_IDLE_CUSTOM, then the build should use a custom IDLE loop in the board src/ directory.
024364eeef	Gregory Nutt	Thu May 10 15:59:40 2018 -0600	Clean up some spacing in the last commit... Seemed like a good idea at the time, but it is better to be consisten than better.

9a1277bd8f	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 29 09:47:09 2018 -0600	Makefile.unix:  There is a sort command in the 'make savedefconfig' file.  I found that sort behaves differently on different platforms based on the environment variable LC_ALL.  Now, Makefile.unix will force LC_ALL=C just for the sort command so that we can all generate equivalent defconfig files.

cfc5f86862	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 25 10:13:59 2018 -0600	net/udp:  Minor update from review of 091e3f732e08dfd54359371150185cecbc1ca0e9.  In connect(), AF_UNSPEC is used to disconnect UDP socket.  However, initial commit lacked logic to mark the socket as disconnected.
091e3f732e	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 25 08:43:38 2018 -0600	net/udp:  Fix several issues using connected UDP sockets:  sendto() should not accept and address.  Normally send() should be used instead.  recvfrom() is no longer necessary.  recvfrom() and poll() should not reset to accept any addresses but should, instead, only accept inputs and events from the connected remore peer.  On of these issues was noted by 李桂丁 <liguiding@pinecone.net>.  Changes were made as summarized here: http://www.masterraghu.com/subjects/np/introduction/unix_network_programming_v1.3/ch08lev1sec11.html
31e3f208b2	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 25 08:28:49 2018 -0600	tools/configure.sh:  Fix last commit.  If gmake is not present, then 'which gmake' spews a lot of annoying error messages when configuring.  Best to pipe stderr to /dev/null so that we are blessedly unaware of the failures.

3012abdc45	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 24 06:53:24 2018 -0600	configs/stm32f4discovery/hciuart:  Disable MMC/SD support.  That made it difficult to re-use the configuration without the base board.  MMC/SD support is not needed in that configuration anyway.

505f460b6b	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 21 18:03:01 2018 -0600	configs:  Review all implementations of board_lcd_initialize().  The NuttX convention is that all internal functions that return errors as an 'int' must return a negated errno value on failure and a non-negative value on success.  Most were right but eight of them had cloned logic that returns 1 on success and zero on failure... both of which are interpreted as success by the caller since they are non-negative.

The operation of dispatching messages can be performed just as well on the high and low priority work queue.  The network driver operates the low priority work queue so that also integrates better with network frame reception.

1224db454b	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 18 08:17:15 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32 and drivers/wireless/bluetooth:  Fix some buffer management errors in HCI UART upper and lower halves.
d93b22d042	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 17 15:34:12 2018 -0600	net/sixlowpan:  Fix a nasty, byte-ordering/endian-ness problem.  The root cause has been found and corrected.  And a half dozen or so bandaid fixes were reverted.
27f624d881	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 17 13:07:28 2018 -0600	drivers/wireless/bluetooth: Default BAUD must be 115200, Fix logic in Rx callback, Rx callback must execute on work queue.  Now sends and receives one command and response.  But hangs on the next.
021b4954d7	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 17 09:17:44 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  Add power management hooks
c13e54de10	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 17 08:30:16 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32:  Fix an error in the HCI UART.  It was setting 9- vs 8-bit word size.
0271a6a5e9	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 17 07:13:03 2018 -0600	drivers/wireless/bluetooth:  Fix error in testing if interrupts enabled.
862ff9cae3	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 16 17:14:51 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32/:  In HCI UART, sense of RTS and CTS are inverted.  When we speak of asserting RTS we mean setting nRTS to zero.
603efe6fb5	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 16 15:24:17 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32 and configs/stm32f4discovery:  Some feeble attempts to communicate with the BT860.  Not much progress yet.
5fc2f7a36c	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 16 10:33:35 2018 -0600	net/sixlowpan: Simplify redundant check in the previous commit.  If fullmac == true, then we must also have usemac == true and so checking usemac in that context is redundant.
d59c97208c	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 16 09:30:04 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imxrt:  Fix problem with with CPU hanging during boot in the clockconfig function.  configs/imxrt1050-evk/scripts:  Update linker script so that the NXP boot header will be included in the build.
9ddce0b324	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 16 08:02:42 2018 -0600	net/sixlowpan:  Grrr.. got conditional logic reversed in the last commit
12002d1604	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 16 07:34:02 2018 -0600	net/sixlowpan:  When uncompressing link local addresses, the source of the address matters.  Apparently address by byte reversed in IP addresses.  But if the source of the address is the locally assigned address, bytes are not reversed.
06aee06a8d	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 16 06:40:10 2018 -0600	Revert "net/sixlowpan:  Fix a constant value used in IPv6 address decompression.  The 0x0200 value used in the address modification should be in network order."

949adaa4c9	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 15 02:04:26 2018 +0000	bt_hcicore.c edited online with Bitbucket
91ff7cc785	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 14 17:55:30 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth:  Soften use of enter_critical_sectino() which is a performance hog in SMP configurations.  Replace with spin_lock_irqsave() in most cases.  That is the same for single core CPUs, but much more efficient in SMP configurations.  And better, repace with sched_lock() if there is really no necessity to disable interrupts too.
9aa1c6c3d5	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 14 15:09:12 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth:  Use nxsem_timedwait() vs nxsem_wait() when waiting for response from the HCI device.  Adding this timeout prevents things from hanging when there is a problem with the connect HCI UART (in the current test, when there is no HCI UART connected).
5d2c226675	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 14 11:33:29 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth and drivers/wireless/bluetooth:  Simply the driver registration/initialization interface.
a374c9daf8	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 14 10:04:21 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32:  In HCI UART driver, need to disable Tx interrupts after frame sent.  Otherwise, we get infinite Tx interrupts.
fa287e8863	Gregory Nutt	Sat Apr 14 09:23:08 2018 -0600	Various fixes/changes from intial testing of the HCI UART on the STM32F4-Discovery board.  Re-organized how the Blutetooth network driver is initialized.  Added lots of new debug output.  Add a new STM32 F4 Discovery configuration for testing the HCI UART.  Various fixes to get through initialization (still does not).
0686989645	Gregory Nutt	Fri Apr 13 14:53:11 2018 -0600	configs/stm32fdiscovery:  Add support in bringup logic to initialize the HCI UART and register the HCI UART network device.
d25549ac54	Gregory Nutt	Fri Apr 13 10:36:23 2018 -0600	This commit adds a Bluetooth HCI UART lower half driver for the STM32
e8832be8f1	Gregory Nutt	Fri Apr 13 08:17:25 2018 -0600	net/sixlowpan:  Fix a constant value used in IPv6 address decompression.  The 0x0200 value used in the address modification should be in network order.
b42d31401c	Gregory Nutt	Thu Apr 12 08:11:55 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/wireless.h:  Fix some coding standard violations.  configs/indium-f7:  Fix some compile errors found in build testing.
d97454a7d7	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 11 18:47:59 2018 -0600	tools/README.txt:  Minor tweak to README.
7d7b8a243b	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 11 18:25:35 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32:  Back out a small part of the previous commit ... my fault.

a69d23d48c	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 11 06:59:57 2018 -0600	tools/README.txt:  Update to include uncrustify info.
518262138d	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 11 06:44:04 2018 -0600	tools/uncrustify.cfg:  An initial cut at an uncrustify C formatting script.
730f7450b7	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 9 16:41:27 2018 -0600	Remove all support for the CC3200 and CC3200-Launchpad.  This was a port that was started but never completed.  What good is partial CC3200-Launchpad board support with no wireless support?
ba07978c2a	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 8 07:29:14 2018 -0600	Trivial update to some comments
4fd814982d	Gregory Nutt	Fri Apr 6 16:22:49 2018 -0600	drivers/bluetooth:  Extend device simulation.  Now makes it all the way through initialization without error.  wireless/bluetooth: Add support for IOCTL commangs to get BR/EDR and LE features.
ea84215059	Gregory Nutt	Fri Apr 6 14:07:03 2018 -0600	drivers/bluetooth:  Extend NULL driver to support a little more testing.

5009c22f85	Gregory Nutt	Fri Apr 6 10:39:12 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth:  Implementat SIOCGBTINFO IOCTL command.  Eliminated some redundancy.
cab7ba8b8f	Gregory Nutt	Fri Apr 6 09:42:41 2018 -0600	Bluetooth:  Better integrate NuttX Bluetooth IOCTL commands and NetBSD IOCTL commands.  Stanardize naming.
39e393fa5f	Gregory Nutt	Thu Apr 5 16:38:53 2018 -0600	net/bluetooth:  Since the max header is always reported, the max frame size for purposes of allocation is the max header lenght plus the max payload, even though the frames with the max payload never have the max header length.
33d5325b09	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 4 17:32:25 2018 -0600	STM32 F3:  Fix a couple of new warnings noted in build testing.  There are more new warnings, but I think these may be due to improper default values for some configuration settings.  I have not looked into this in detail.
5000e31c4f	Gregory Nutt	Wed Apr 4 15:39:45 2018 -0600	configs/stm32f344-disco:  Clean up some debug output strings.

04b0ace6b0	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 3 17:57:06 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth: With change the test with the simulated bluetooth driver can get all the way up the point where it determines that the attached controller is not LE capable.  I am not sure how much first to take the simulation.  The time would probably be better invested in bringing up real hardware.
48dd0f3825	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 3 17:23:54 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth:  Fix some confusion in initialization of message queues.
265b5d7dc6	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 3 16:28:22 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth:  A few trivial fixes from initial testing with the simulator.  The simulated Bluetooth device is probably going to be in adequate for any level of testing.
6962f6886c	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 3 10:07:15 2018 -0600	configs/sim:  Add a configuration that will support some limited testing of the Bluetooth stack.
0142a5ad13	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 3 10:00:56 2018 -0600	arch/sim/src:  Variable fixes to get a Bluetooth simulation build.
15d033e32b	Gregory Nutt	Tue Apr 3 09:00:18 2018 -0600	drivers/wireless/bluetooth:  Add a NULL device to support some very low level testing on the Simulator.

49644be9a5	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 2 17:34:41 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/wireless and wireless/bluetooth:  Add support for an IOCTL command to enable Bluetooth security.
9d3a06e55d	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 2 14:42:01 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/wireless:  Remove const from some members of IOCTL structures.  The const makes it awkward to initialize the structure.
bf23588a41	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 2 14:20:01 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/wireless:  Another correction to a Bluetooth IOCTL command structure.
15c7886fad	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 2 13:03:46 2018 -0600	include/nuttx/wireless:  All Bluetooth IOCTL command data must begin with the interface name string.
4ee0917789	Gregory Nutt	Mon Apr 2 06:38:31 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth:  Completes basic Rx/Tx data paths.  Still missing:  device address discovery and pairing logic.
5dd11f465b	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 1 17:53:07 2018 -0600	net/bluetooth:  Add support for connection to any address and any channel.
3a0f3d4be8	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 1 15:45:35 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth:  Buffer allocation was always allocationg a new buffer, even if one was provided.. causing data loss.  Correct initialization of lengths:  IOB lenth includes data offset.  Bluetooth buffer length does not.
aae0d92598	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 1 15:21:58 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth and net/bluetooth:  Clean up some garbage left in Kconfig file that broke 'make menuconfig'.  Clean up some craziness with Bluetooth frame length definitions.
7e05d5e9c7	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 1 14:00:40 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth:  Adds most of the logic to get the Tx path working.  Still missing the logic to recover the Bluetooth connection structure given the destination address in the socket address.
29a4a80f8c	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 1 12:25:30 2018 -0600	Squashed commit of the following:
f7bcad502a	Gregory Nutt	Sat Mar 31 16:31:51 2018 -0600	Bluetooth:  Bring in some definitions from NetBSD.  Update some usage and naming to be more consistent.
0c007be4bd	Gregory Nutt	Sat Mar 31 14:55:03 2018 -0600	This comment adds (1) basic support for AF_BLUETOOTH sockets.  The logic compiles but is still incomplete.  Support for Bluetooth is general is still dependent on CONFIG_EXPERMIMENTAL because it is not yet ready for used.
fd068f17ca	Gregory Nutt	Sat Mar 31 10:37:34 2018 -0600	wireless/ieee802154:  Some trivial typos fixed while working with Bluetooth port
c78b53a74c	Gregory Nutt	Sat Mar 31 09:26:35 2018 -0600	net/ieee802154:  Add some missing logic in connect().
de7000ee3e	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 30 17:43:58 2018 -0600	wireless/ieee802154: Fix a few typos
57f7677128	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 30 15:30:45 2018 -0600	net/udp:  Fix another related error in UDP condition compilatino (was actually using TCP setting, not UDP setting).
2796b0245c	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 30 15:20:19 2018 -0600	net/ieee802154 and include/net/ieee802154:  Fix a few more trivial typos.

51ee2cdd86	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 30 12:03:34 2018 -0600	net/udp:  Fix some errors in conditional compilation.
a2f237065c	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 30 11:33:21 2018 -0600	net/ieee802154:  Fix some typos noted when cloning to create net/bluetooth.
d62649757c	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 30 10:50:44 2018 -0600	wireless/bluetooth and include/nutt/net:  Add support for Bluetooth IOCTL commands.

accef0ca9e	Gregory Nutt	Thu Mar 29 12:35:41 2018 -0600	This commit brings in the Bluetooth stack from the Intel/Zephyr arduino101_firmware_source-v1.tar package.
8d5b225928	Gregory Nutt	Tue Mar 27 15:33:59 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32:  If Ethernet initialization failures (per previous commit), then do not register the uninitialized Ethernet device.  Ths prevents any use of the badly initialized interface.
759e510c28	Gregory Nutt	Mon Mar 26 13:54:47 2018 -0600	Per Matias Edlund:  I recently used the tcflush function and found that it failed with ENOTTY. The reason is that the TCFLSH case in the function uart_ioctl in the file drivers/serial/serial.c does not update the ret value."  On success, the TCFLSH IOCTL logic needs to explicitly set the return value (ret) to zero.
dc8941e958	Gregory Nutt	Sun Mar 25 09:25:37 2018 -0600	configs/:  Add definition of strip to many Make.defs files.
db3b507a41	Gregory Nutt	Sat Mar 24 15:05:22 2018 -0600	tools/gencromfs.c:  Was duplicating all mode bits in source directory in CROMFS directory.  Some make no sense.  In particular, all write-able bits are cleard unconditionally.  Executable bits are still copying because there is really no way for the tool to know if the file is executable or not.
67e0603b5a	Gregory Nutt	Sat Mar 24 14:44:38 2018 -0600	fs/cromfs:  Block length only needs to be uint16_t, not uint32_t.  Add pading to node structure to assue that alignment is the same on all platforms.  tools/gencromfs.c:  Fix the target offset of the '.' hard link.
853c1234ac	Gregory Nutt	Sat Mar 24 11:54:01 2018 -0600	tools/gencromfs.c:  Missing 'const'.  CROMFS file system was ending up in data, not FLASH
8b4b61f140	Gregory Nutt	Sat Mar 24 11:30:35 2018 -0600	fs/cromfs:  Fix a error in reading partial compressed blocks.  The LZF decompressor does not support that operation.  Instead we have to decompress full block into a temporary buffer and copy out the parts that we need.  To compensate for the performance hit, a caching mechanism was added so that we do not have to read the same block repeatedly.  Unrelated:  Also updates some README files.
e35228ece9	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 23 16:55:12 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/imx6:  Bring in a few i.MX6 fixes that were committed on the i.MX RT branch.
d107ef6d54	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 23 11:05:53 2018 -0600	configs/cc3200-launchpad:  I don't think that there is any reason for BINFS to be enabled in the NSH configuration.
3810f9e942	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 23 07:37:49 2018 -0600	Remove configurations using canutils/libuavcan and examples/uavcan.  libuavcan has not built for a year or so.  The basic problem is that as NuttX advances, the old frozen versino of libuavcan has become absolute because it violates the portable POSIX OS interface.  No one is maintaining the port so there is no alternative but to remove it.
00d8d6698e	Gregory Nutt	Thu Mar 22 15:54:03 2018 -0600	Documentation/NuttxPortingGuide.html:  Some updated wording of description of the directories need for a complete board configuration.

The same trivial change was done with an online edit, but this resulted in some corruption of special characters in the file, likely because of differences with the character set used by the Bitbucket online editor.
0199af6551	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 21 20:07:39 2018 -0600	Revert "NuttxPortingGuide.html edited online with Bitbucket"

3ec02adee0	Gregory Nutt	Wed Mar 21 08:40:02 2018 -0600	tools/genromfs.c:  Improve check for empty directories.  If the directory contains only unsupported, special files, then it is still empty.  Fix some collection of statistics that was cause statfs() to return some incorrect values.  Add logic to handle the case where the host and the target differ in endian-ness.  fs/procfs:  In show mountpoints, add support so that the CROMFS file system type is recognized.
448fc7a6f2	Gregory Nutt	Tue Mar 20 20:04:29 2018 -0600	fs/cromfs:  Remove CONFIG_EXPERIMINTAL dependency.

aeeee54921	Gregory Nutt	Tue Mar 20 14:30:05 2018 -0600	tools/gencromfs.c and fs/cromfs:  More corrections to directory traversal logic.  Still some bugs.
22484386ee	Gregory Nutt	Tue Mar 20 12:37:01 2018 -0600	fs/cromfs and tools/gencromfs:  Various fixes for traversal relative file paths.  Biggest changes is in types used:  Cannot use size_t or mode_t in common structures because they have different sizes on the (64-bit) host and the (32-bit) target.  Use uint32_t instead of size_t for offsets.  Use uint16_t instead of mode_t.
87fd4e2916	Gregory Nutt	Tue Mar 20 10:37:42 2018 -0600	fs/cromfs:  Fix read logic.  tools/genromfs.c:  Last node in directory needs to have zero for peer offset.  Still some issues with empty directories.
d6b9802264	Gregory Nutt	Tue Mar 20 08:50:59 2018 -0600	tools/gencromfs.c:  Fix a mixconception about how nested directories should be traversed.
eec44d1f01	Gregory Nutt	Tue Mar 20 07:31:13 2018 -0600	This commit adds tools/gencromfs.c, a tool that can be used to generate CROMFS file system images.
278cc6f70a	Gregory Nutt	Mon Mar 19 16:50:45 2018 -0600	libc/lzf:  Fix some typos in code that was in conditional logic that was not building.  Change a literal use of 13 to HLOG which used to be 13.

This is necessary because accessing the TCB of the currenlty running task is, itself, a non-atomic operation.  This global scheduler lock cpability was add just to support that atomic access to the TCB.

49d07162bf	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jan 26 11:34:48 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32: stm32_rtcc.h should be used to access BKP registers on F2, F3, and F4.
bffa425233	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jan 26 11:26:40 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32: stm32_bkp.h should only be used for STM32 F1
fc387b9aa0	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jan 26 11:18:46 2018 -0600	arch/arm/src/stm32:  Remove bogus definitions of STM32_BKP_BASE from the F2, F3, and F4 memory maps.  Unlike the F1, these parts do not have a separate BKP address region.  The BKP registers are with the RTCC address regions.
9e60dffc5a	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jan 26 08:50:21 2018 -0600	arch/srm/src/stm32f7:  Remove confusing, redundant, and misleading STM32_BKP_BASE definitions.

822e67692b	Gregory Nutt	Wed Jan 24 08:52:40 2018 -0600	configs/flipnclick-sam3x:  Using JTAG (vs. Bossac) I was finally able to load code and verify the basic NSH configuration.  Updated READMEs.  Also switched to USART0 (vs UART0) for the serial console because I was not getting bi-directional communication on the VCOM.

055a3ef844	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jan 22 14:14:32 2018 -0600	net/udp:  Remove some conditional logic that was true if there is only a single network device, but not true in the multi-device context.
5ab4eb4f30	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jan 22 11:11:23 2018 -0600	net/tcp:  Write buffering logic should not wait for a free buffer if the socket was opened non-blocking.  Also, rename the TCP write buffering macros from WRB_* to TCPWB_* to make room in the namespace for write buffering with other protocols.
fccd44387a	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jan 22 08:17:31 2018 -0600	The existence of the network driver ioctl() method should depend on CONFIG_NETDEV_IOCTL rather than CONFIG_NETDEV_PHY_IOCTL.  The former enables the method, the later enables a subset of possible driver IOCTLs.  This change should be basically a no-operation.  The affected ioctl methods only support those subset of driver IOCTLs selected by CONFIG_NETDEV_PHY_IOCTL and the network logic will tolerate a nul ioctl method.

That was a great idea to save CPU cycles when there is nothing reading from the touchscrren but, unfortunately, does not work with readers that open the driver in non-blocking mode.  So I think we just have to eat the CPUs even when there is nothing waiting for touchscreen input.

e238c8b090	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jan 15 11:05:45 2018 -0600	sched/clock/clock_systimer.c:  Change the way that the 64-bit time is sampled.  Previously, we disabled interrupts before sampling the 64-bit timer since the uint64_t access is not atomic on most CPUs.  However, disabling (local) interrupts does not work in the SMP case.  In that case, the timer interrupt will be running on only one of the CPUs; disabling interrupts on a different CPU will provide no protection from timer rollover.  To work around this, logic was added that samples 64-bit timer is sampled twice and if 32-bit rollover was detected between samples, then loops until there is no rollover.

cf5cba953d	Gregory Nutt	Thu Oct 19 11:55:51 2017 -0600	There was a possible recursion that could eventually overflow the stack.  The error occurred when closing the socket with inet_close() while a socket callback was still queued.  When the socket callback was executed by devif_conn_event(), this resulted in a call to psock_send_eventhandler() with TCP_CLOSE flag set which then called tcp_lost_connection().  tcp_shutdown_monitor() then called tcp_callback() again, which again called psock_send_eventhandler(), and so on....  Noted by Pascal Speck.  Solution is also similar to a solution proposed by Pascal Speck.
bc40403516	Gregory Nutt	Thu Oct 19 11:09:23 2017 -0600	There was a reference counting problem in the TPC logic of net_clone().  net_clone() which is the common logic underlying dup() and dup2() for sockets.  When net_clone() calls net_start_monitor() and net_start_monitor() returns a failure (because the underlying TCP connection) then net_clone() must back out the reference count on the structure.  Problem noted by Pascal Speck and this implementation of the solution is based on his suggestion.

a857cc04e4	Gregory Nutt	Sun Oct 8 08:13:47 2017 -0600	Fix some build problems after recent separation of internal OS from application interfaces.  The build problem only occurs in the PROTECTED and KERNEL builds where separate libraries are built for the applications and for use within the OS. In these cases, the correct interfaces must be used.  This commit fixes a few of these, so I can get through build testing, but there are many more that need fixin'.

5b04c25dcd	Gregory Nutt	Fri Oct 6 10:55:36 2017 -0600	drivers/serial/tcdrain:  tcdrain() was recently added to the NuttX C library.  But there is a problem.  The specification of tcdrain() requires that it be a cancellation point.  In order to do this, tcdrain was moved from the C library into the OS and the addition cancellation point hooks were added.  In non-FLAT builds, access via system calls is also now supported.
936df1bcb5	Gregory Nutt	Fri Oct 6 10:15:01 2017 -0600	Adds new OS internal functions nxsig_sleep() and nxsig_usleep.  These differ from the standard sleep() and usleep() in that (1) they don't cause cancellation points, and (2) don't set the errno variable (if applicable).  All calls to sleep() and usleep() changed to calls to nxsig_sleep() and nxsig_usleep().

29b5b3667f	Gregory Nutt	Thu Oct 5 07:24:54 2017 -0600	sched/semaphore:  sem_timedwait() is a cancellation point and, hence, cannot be called from within the OS.  Created nxsem_timedwait() that is equivalent but does not modify the errno and does not cause cancellation.  All calls to sem_timedwait() change to calls to nxsem_timedwait() in the OS.

8e966546c1	Gregory Nutt	Tue Oct 3 07:09:35 2017 -0600	syscall/:  The non-standard interface exec() is now enshrined as a official NuttX API.  I really dislike doing this but I think that this is probably the only want to load programs in the protected mode.  It is currently used by some example code under apps/ that generate their own symbol tables for linking.  Other file execution APIs relay on a symbol table provided by the OS.  In the protected mode, the OS cannot provide any meaning symbol table for execution of code in the user-space blob so that is they exec() is really needed in that build case.  And, finally, the interface is completely useless and will not be supported in the KERNEL build mode where the contrary is true:  An application process cannot provide any meaning symbolic information for use in linking a different process.

7fbceacb46	Gregory Nutt	Mon Sep 11 09:35:39 2017 -0600	Mark an untested driver as EXPERIMENTAL in its Kconfig; Update some comments.
6a6bf1b62f	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 10 11:40:54 2017 -0600	:Remove CONFIG_NET_6LOWPAN_FRAMELEN.  In this case where multiple radios are support3d, this may not be a constant.  6LoWPAN now always queries the driver to get the maximum frame length.
c217c663ae	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 10 10:49:27 2017 -0600	6LoWPAN: Remove the option to disable fragmentation support.  Two reasons:  (1) First fragementation is always required becaues IPv6 requires an MTU of 1280 bytes.  The is no application use case that can work without fragmentation support.  And (2) it greatly reduces the complexity of the code.
334d1734dc	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 10 10:13:33 2017 -0600	6LoWPAN/Radio:  Rename radio property sp_pktlen to sp_framelen.  Add 6LoWPAN utility to get the max frame length (not yet hooked in)

860ff78d55	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 3 12:44:45 2017 -0600	Kinetis: First cut implementation of the alarm read function.  Pretty simple because the Kinetis RTC is just a 1Hz counter.
5f67fc8f1b	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 3 12:20:13 2017 -0600	RTC alarms:  getalarmdatetime functions are private and should be declared static.
789e204141	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 3 09:51:47 2017 -0600	Correct naming of fields in struct alm_rdalarm_s.  Should not be the same as the corresponding fields of struct alm_setalarm_s.  The whole purpose of that naming convention is to keep the field names unique.
f42a8a38eb	Gregory Nutt	Sun Sep 3 08:38:37 2017 -0600	Add hooks for Boris Astardzhiev's RTC change for STM32L4 to Kinetis. Lower level logic not yet implemented.

8c2e3a2d0a	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 1 11:56:48 2017 -0600	Networking:  Fix a copy/paste error introduced with recent disconnection changes.
afe137ffbf	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 1 07:13:03 2017 -0600	net_timedwait() and net_lockedwait() no longer return errors via errno but returned negated errno values like other internal OS functions.

4993b0cb66	Gregory Nutt	Thu Aug 31 07:43:47 2017 -0600	Work queue:  In a recent change for a problem noted by Pascal Speck, it was noted (again by Pascal Speck) that the cancellation of existing work and replacement with new work must be atomic.  Thanks, Pascal.
d74381ca72	Gregory Nutt	Thu Aug 31 07:29:44 2017 -0600	Networking:  Missed removal of one net_unlock() in previous commit.
7ebef900fb	Gregory Nutt	Thu Aug 31 07:23:19 2017 -0600	Networking:  Fix a race condition.  The accept() operation is performed with the network locked.  However, the network is unlocked BEFORE the connected state is set.  Therefore, a context switch may occur and the socket may no longer be connected when it is marked so.  Noted by Pascal Speck.
9d3b1af1cd	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 30 13:56:03 2017 -0600	ARM syscall logic:  Clear bit 0 in PC settings.  Bit 0 is the thumb mode indication and should not be set in the PC.
8e6c78f425	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 30 13:44:13 2017 -0600	Fix last commit.  It violates the NuttX coding standard because it is not C89 compliant.
581db174b2	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 30 10:29:14 2017 -0600	Networking:  socket dup() conditional operation was missing the test for the condition.

c509fbbdab	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 30 08:00:35 2017 -0600	Porting Guide:  Add usage tip for reading CAN messages from the CAN driver without losing message.
4cba634a12	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 30 07:05:30 2017 -0600	Mostly cosmetic changes from review of last PR.  Also same inappropriate use of _info changes to configurable debug macros.  Remember folks, if it has a _ or __ in front, it is not intended for use outside of the header file.  It is an internal private definition.
0b2a4eb4bd	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 29 15:08:38 2017 -0600	Networking:  A little more wording changes related to interrupts vs. events
04ad162540	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 29 14:08:04 2017 -0600	Networking:  Clean up some naming that has bothered me for a long time... There are no interrupts and no interrupt handlers in the network.  There are events and event handler (there used to to be interrupt logic in there years ago but that is long, long gone).
171d183e8e	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 29 13:24:49 2017 -0600	Networking:  A placeholder for some missing logic in the previous change related to monitoring network status for dup'ed sockets.  If one of the dup'ed socket's is closed, then network monitor resources associated with that one socket must be recovered.  Also, in the event that socket is being used on one thread, but then closed on another, any threads waiting for events from the socket should be informed of the closure.  That latter requirement is not implemented because current data structures do not support it.
0f7a52bc28	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 29 12:27:58 2017 -0600	Networking:  Fix a runaway recursion problem introduced the previous fixe for shutting down dup'ed sockets.
d40ee8e79d	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 29 10:53:04 2017 -0600	Networking:  Start the network monitor for a socket when a TCP socket is dup'ed.
9db65dea78	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 29 10:38:01 2017 -0600	Networking:  TCP disconnection callbacks are not retained in a list.  This will support mutiple callbacks per lower-level TCP connection structure.  That is necessary for the cae where a socket is dup'ed and shares the same lower-level connection structure.  NOTE:  There still needs to be a call to tcp_start_monitor() when the socket is dup'ed.
ed58536c3a	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 29 09:25:22 2017 -0600	Networking:  Move two more TCP specific files from inet/ to tcp/.  There is other TCP-specific logic in inet/ that should be moved sometime, but those are more entangled.
92f44c5607	Gregory Nutt	Tue Aug 29 08:40:13 2017 -0600	Networking: Move net/inet/net_monitor.c to net/tcp/tcp_monitor.c in preparation for design change to fix monitoring of duplicated sockets.
024113b90e	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 28 13:03:53 2017 -0600	Work queues... correct cloning error in last commit
bbf4d5048a	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 28 07:46:48 2017 -0600	work_queue() must cancel existing work prior to queuing new work, otherwise the work queue can become corrupted.  Problem noted by Pascal Speck.

48c27f8ffc	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 26 11:38:44 2017 -0600	Simulator: Adds necessary functionality to build Simulator under ARM Linux. Tested only on Raspberry3. Currently setjmp/longjmp do not save/restore floating point registers.  Patch provided by Bitbucket user nbkolchin.
88a87f8e3f	Gregory Nutt	Sat Aug 26 10:00:47 2017 -0600	6LoWPAN:  The original, Contiki-based design used only a single buffer for reassemblying larger packets.  This could be a problem issue for hub configurations which really need the capability concurrently reassemble multiple incoming streams concurrently.  These was also a design issue in that the reassembly buffer could be corrupted by outgoing packets.  The design was extended to support multiple reassembly buffers, each associated with the reassembly tag and source address.  This assures that there can be be no corruption of the reassembly once it has started.

77534e2b49	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 21 08:18:53 2017 -0600	PF_IEEE802154:  Improve some backlog counting logic; add more assertions to catch cases where the backlog count might deviate from the actual backlog.
6b7a26c95c	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 21 07:52:43 2017 -0600	PF_IEEE802154:  Add a maximum backlog option.  This will prevent overrun of the RX frame queue if many frames are received from the radio, but no application is receiving the queued data.
0eac90f775	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 21 07:13:34 2017 -0600	PF_IEEE802154: On input, there may be a list of frames provided, not just one.  When closed() and connection is freed, also need to free any frames remaining in the RX queue.
969d7c5814	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 21 06:27:29 2017 -0600	Networking:  Remove driver based backlog support.  This affects the entire network, but is used by only one driver.  The only supported with of supported RX backlog is via common read-ahead buffering.

1ac4848686	Gregory Nutt	Mon Aug 7 09:22:16 2017 -0600	Spirit bugfixes:  Was hanging occasionally because there was not mechanism to restart the poll timer if poll was not performed because Spirit ws busy.  Fixed by not checking if Spirit is busy.  The TX poll can be performed asynchronouly while spirit is busy; any outgoing data will queued until Spirit is ready. Fixed handling of a timeout condition.  Failure to transmition to the TX state would fail (timeout) if in a race condition Spirit already committed to the RX state.  The driver needs to recover the state properly and avoid debug assertions in this event.

d9a2a3c3f1	Gregory Nutt	Mon Jul 17 06:50:39 2017 -0600	Networking: When upd_input() cannot process a packet, it returns ERROR so that network drivers may try calling ipv4_input() later.  In this case, it must also set d_len to zero.  Otherwise, all network drivers will assume tht there is also an outgoing packet.  This results in a gratuitous ARP.

Since the number of defaults that you now have to answer is so large, the option lets you just accept the default values.

af8c5c86f3	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jun 30 09:32:17 2017 -0600	6LowPan:  Change how the destination node address is handled in the start endpoint configuration.   When the star endpoint sent the IPv6 destination address, the HC06 compression logic elided the address -- meaning that it could be reconstructed by the recipient based on the receiver's assigned short address.  However, when intercepted by the hub, the uncompressed address does not know the short address of the recipient and instead uses the short address of the hub.  This means two things:  (1) it looks like  the hub address is the destination address, and (2) the uncompressed UDP packet has a bad checksum.  This change assures that the destination IPv6 address is not elided in the case of the star endpoint configuration.

a93f130002	Gregory Nutt	Wed Jun 28 15:39:21 2017 -0600	6LoWPAN:  Add configurable support for 6LoWPAN star topology.  With this change, the endpoints which are the 'points' of the star will forward all traffic to the coordinator.  The coordinator is assumed to be the 'hub' of the star.  This function also implements IPv6 forwarding.  That forwarding implementation is minimal, just enough to support the forwarding requirements of the star hub node.

1c9859520f	Gregory Nutt	Fri May 12 07:31:50 2017 -0600	syslog:  There is yet another place where the output can get split.  That is in syslog_dev_write():  It will break up the stream to insert a CR before the LF.  This can that can be avoid be generating the CR-LF sequence in the buffer and then detecting and ignoring valid CR-LF sequences, rather than expecting syslog_dev_write() to insert the CR in this case.
0fc068cc9c	Gregory Nutt	Fri May 12 06:58:33 2017 -0600	syslog: Avoid flushing syslog_stream buffer, if possible, until lib_vsprintf() completely parses the format.  This assures that the flush will flush the entire output, even data that may potentially follow the linefeed.  And, in that case, it cannot be interleaved with other devug output.  Suggested by Jussi Kivilinna.

Therefore, we can simplify the conditional logic of the last PR.  Negative logic was used (#ifndef BOARD_DISABLE_USBOTG_HSULPI) to prevent bad settings in other configurations.  But give these facts, the preferred positive logic now makes more sense (#ifdef BOARD_ENABLE_USBOTG_HSULPI).

360539afac	Gregory Nutt	Fri Mar 10 09:30:15 2017 -0600	Priority inheritance:  When CONFIG_SEM_PREALLOCHOLDERS==0, there is only a single, hard-allocated holder structure.  This is problem because in sem_wait() the holder is released, but needs to remain in the holder container until sem_restorebaseprio() is called.  The call to sem_restorebaseprio() must be one of the last things the sem_wait() does because it can cause the task to be suspended. If in sem_wait(), a new task gets the semaphore count then it will fail to allocate the holder and will not participate in priority inheritance.  This fix is to add two hard-allocated holders in the sem_t structure:  One of the old holder and one for the new holder.

a3b4475474	Gregory Nutt	Thu Mar 9 13:49:25 2017 -0600	STM32, STM32 F7, and STM32 L4:  Back out part of 3331e9c49aaaa6dcc3aefa6a9e2c80422ffedcd3.  Returning immediately int he case of a NAK makes the Mass Storage Class driver unreliable.  The retry/timeout logic is necessary.  This implementation tries to implement a compromise:  If a NAK is received after some data is received, then the partial data received is returned as with 3331e9c49aaaa6dcc3aefa6a9e2c80422ffedcd3.  If if a NAK is received with no data, then no longer returns the NAK error immediately but retries until data is received or a timeout occurs.  Initial testing indicates that this fixes the issues the MSC.  However, I hae concerns that if multiple sectors are read in one transfer, there could be NAKs between sectors as well and, in that case, then change will still cause failures.

That permits concurrent access to the tasks lists and many subtle problems.  This fix just remains in the critical section throughout the operation (and possible until the task is restore in the event of a context switch).  Makes a big difference in stability

In those cases, the release of the pending tasks must be deferred until those conditions are met.

The new internal interface is sched_cpu_pause(tcb).  This function will pause a CPU if the task associated with 'tcb' is running on that CPU.  This allows a different CPU to modify that OS data stuctures associated with the CPU.  When the other CPU is resumed, those modifications can safely take place.

610afe9cd9	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 3 13:32:52 2016 -0600	FAT performance improvement. In large files, seeking to a position fromt he beginning of the file can be very time consuming.  ftell does lssek(fd, 0, SET_CURR).  In that case, that is wasted time since we are going to seek to the same position.  This fix short-circutes fat_seek() in all cases where we attempt to seek to curren position.  Suggested by Nate Weibley

9a8c3572db	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jul 22 07:47:59 2016 -0600	serial.c:  Fix a race condition noted by Stefan Kolb.  Between the test if the TX buffer is full and entering a critical section, bytes may be removed from the TX buffer making the wait unnecessary.  The unnecessary wait is an inefficiency, but not really a problem.  But with USB CDC/ACM it can be a problem because the entire TX buffer may be emptied when we lose the race.  If that happens that uart_putxmitchar() can hang waiting for data to be removed from an empty TX buffer.

28a4ca6713	Gregory Nutt	Sun Apr 10 14:35:45 2016 -0600	libc/signal and include/signal.h: Rename sigset() to signal().  sigset() is the System V function; signal() is the obsoleted POSIX name.

All Ethernet drivers that collect statistics have been adapted to use these common statistics.

d78d3ef4ab	Gregory Nutt	Mon Sep 7 14:40:18 2015 -0600	Logic for delayed memory garbage collection for the case of user space memory will not work as implemented for the case of the kernel build.  That is because the correct context is in place in order to free the user memory when sched_kufree is called, but will not be in place later when the memory garbage collection runs.  If this feature is really needed, then some more substantial redesign is required

On bind(), the local address should be used to associate a device with the connection (if the local address is not INADDR_ANY); On connect(), the remote address should be used (in case the local address is INADDR_ANY).  On accept(), it does not matter but the remote address is the one guarenteed to be available.

This is not good because it means that packets may sometimes be sent out on the wrong device.  That is inefficient because it   will cause retransmissions and bad performance.  But, worse, when one of the devices is not Ethernet, it will have a different MSS and, as a result, incorrect data transfers can cause crashes.  The fix is to lock into a single device once the MSS is locked locked down.

It used to call memory management functions in user space via function pointers in the userspace interface.  That is inefficient because the first thing that those memory management functions do is to trap back into the kernel to get the current PID.  Worse, that operation can be fatal is certain fragile situations such as when a task is exitting.

Also add sysyscall support for mq_setattr() and mq_getattr().  This is necessary in protected and kernel builds because in those cases the message queue structure is protect and cannot be accessed directly from user mode code.  Noted by Jouko Holopainen.

b493dde4cf	Gregory Nutt	Sun May 31 11:35:28 2015 -0600	TCP networking:  In the TCP connection operation, it was trying to setup the network monitor BEFORE the socket was successfully connected.  This, of course, has ALWAYS failed because the socket is not yet connected and the TCP state is not yet correct for a connected socket.  However, because of other changes net_startmonitor(0 no returns a failure condition that causes worse problems when trying to connect.  The fix is to move the logic that starts the network monitor to AFTER the socket has been successfully connected.

33085cb309	Gregory Nutt	Sun May 31 08:34:03 2015 -0600	Networking:  The network device list was protected by a re-entrant semaphore.  With the recent change to support network device callback, the network stack needs to access the network device list too. Some drivers, however, run the network stack from the interrupt level -- this is bad but a fact in the current state.  Of course,those drivers are unable to take the semaphore and will assert.

28b46c7bfa	Gregory Nutt	Sat May 30 12:54:18 2015 -0600	To be valid, a network device must not only exist, but be in the UP state
cc340aaa92	Gregory Nutt	Sat May 30 11:49:55 2015 -0600	TCP networking: Since the network monitor now allocates a callback structure, it is critical to make sure that the networking monitor is stopped when the socket is closed or any other loss of connection.  What was innocuous before would now be a memory leak

That is because the timeout is limited to stops of 1 decisecond and because the conversion of structure timeval was truncating the microsecond remainder.  The utility net_timeval2dsec now accespts and option to determin how it handles the remainder:  truncate, discarding the remainder, use the remainder to round to the closed decisecond value, or use any non-zero remainder to the next larger whole decisecond value.

e81f279315	Gregory Nutt	Thu May 28 12:01:38 2015 -0600	Networking: Modify event list handling:  Now there are two event lists each device structure:  (1) One is for ARP and ICMP data related evetns, the other is for device related events.  Callback allocation/free routines no accept a device paramter as well as a list: If the device paramter is added, then the callback goes into both the connection-related liast AND the device event list.  Thus each socket type can received both custom data-related events as well as common device related events.

01d176af76	Gregory Nutt	Thu May 28 08:23:51 2015 -0600	net_startmonitor.c always returned zero.  In the case where a socket has already been closed, it correctly handled the disconnetion event but still returned OK.  Returning OK causes the callers of net_startmonitor to assume that the connection was okay, undoing the good things that net_startmonitor did and causing the socket to be marked as connected.  This behavior was noted by Pelle Windestam.

1025c3fb21	Gregory Nutt	Thu Apr 9 10:35:07 2015 -0600	Fixes to asinh(), atanh(), and sinh(): The 'basic' expansions all exhibited bad cancellation errors near zero (<= 1E-10). This can be easily seen e.g. with x = 1E-30, the results are all zero though they should be extremely close to x. The cutoff values (1E-5, 1E-9) are chosen so that the next term in the Taylor series is negligible (for double). Functions could maybe be optimized to use only first term (x) and a smaller cutoff, just bigger than where the cancellation occurs.

This function will eventually replace all of the ad hoc OS interfaces that are current used to perform application specific intialiation and application driver test confifuration.  It essentially formalizes and institutionalizes these rogue interface in to at least a single crazy call.

The end result is that newly opened or cloned file structures were never being added to the list of open files.  So when the unmount() happens, it always looked like there were not open files and a crash could ensue.

f0d318c124	Gregory Nutt	Mon Feb 9 16:12:11 2015 -0600	Big, very risky change:  Remove all occurrences of up_maskack_irq() that disable and enable interrupts with up_ack_irq() that only acknowledges the interrupts.  This is only used in interrupt decoding logic.  Also remove the logic that unconditionally re-enables interrupts with the interrupt exits.  This interferes with the drivers ability to control the interrupt state.  This is a necessary, sweeping, global change and unfortunately impossible to test.

e86d00913e	Gregory Nutt	Fri Jan 30 11:14:24 2015 -0600	Unix domain/FIFOs:  Fix a race condition between FIFO buffer operations and the opening and closing of FIFOs which necessary when the FIFOs are used to support Unix domain, datagram sockets.  The default policy is the deallocate FIFO buffering when the last client closes the pipe.  When when used for datagram communicatinos, packets left in the FIFO will be lost.  Some like UDP read-ahead is needed:  The buffered data in the FIFO needs to be retained until the reader gets a chance to re-open the FIFO.  Added an ioctl (PIPEIOC_POLICY) to control the buffer policy. Default (0) is the legacy behavior; Unix domain datagram logic sets the alternative policy so that the packet data persists after the FIFO is closed.

Some connection logic was reorder -- setting the socket got moved BEFORE the point where the check was made if the socket was already connected.  The resulting behavior was odd:  Telnet would connect, but then when you exit and reconnect, it would fail to connect.  But then if try again, it would connect okay. So the symptom was connect-fail-connect-fail-...

371a9fd84c	Gregory Nutt	Wed Jan 28 11:56:11 2015 -0600	Networking:  Fix another deadlock condition.  tcp_write_buffer_alloc() calls sem_wait() with network locked.  That worked if CONFIG_NET_NOINTS was not defined because interrupts are automatically restored when the wait happens.  But with CONFIG_NET_NOINTS=y, the wait blocks with the network locked -- bad style and also can lead to a deadlock condition

c4bd6f52b5	Gregory Nutt	Tue Jan 27 21:23:42 2015 -0600	Networking:  The are issues with the TCP write-ahead buffering if CONFIG_NET_NOINTS is enabled:  There is a possibility of deadlocks in certain timing conditions.  I have not seen this with the Tiva driver that I have been users but other people claim to see the issue on other platforms.  Certainly it is a logic error:  The network should never wait for TCP read-ahead buffering space to be available.  It should drop the packets immediately.

On x86, va_list is a pointer to a single copy on the stack.  avsprintf() calls lib_vsprintf() twice and so traverses the va_list twice using va_start.  va_start modifies that single copy on the stack so that the second call to lib_vsprintf() fails.  This appears to be an issue with x86 only so far

e31d5125ae	Gregory Nutt	Sat Nov 29 10:53:22 2014 -0600	Add support for a variadic ioctl() function.  The ioctl() interface is a non-standard, Unix interface.  NuttX has always used the older, three-parameter version.  Most contemporary systems now, however, use a variadic form of the ioctl() function.  Added an option to insert a shim layer to adapt the three-parameter ioctl() to use the variadic interface form.  Internally, the ioctl handling is the same three-parameter logic.  The only real complexity to the shim is in how the system calls must be handled.

Immediate timeout is achieved by setting absolute timeout value to past time, for example abstime={ .tv_sec=0, .tv_nsec=0 }. However absolute time was converted to relative time using unsigned integer arithmetic and resulted large ticks count by clock_abstime2ticks, instead of expected negative ticks value.

79fa2a7b09	Gregory Nutt	Fri Sep 12 08:04:27 2014 -0600	ARMv7-A: Modify up_fullcontextrestore() for CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL.  It changed CPSR while in kernel.  That will crash is the new CPSR is user mode while executing in kernel space.  Fixed by adding a SYS_context_restore system call.  There is an alternative, simpler modification to up_fullcontextrestore() that could have been done:  It might have been possible to use the SPSR instead of the CPRSR and then do an exception return from up_fullcontextrestore().  That would be more efficient, but I never tried it.

899025527c	Gregory Nutt	Thu Aug 7 18:00:38 2014 -0600	Change all time conversions.  Yech.  New timer units in microseconds breaks all existing logic that used milliseconds in the conversions.  Something likely got broken doing this, probably because I confused a MSEC2TICK conversion with a TICK2MSEC conversion.  Also, the tickless OS no appears fully functional and passes the OS test on the simulator with no errors

f0eb4235d1	Gregory Nutt	Wed Aug 6 18:25:42 2014 -0600	Add a new option CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS to enable the tickless OS.  This is a work in progress but should be relatively safe since the new features are only enabled by this option (Safer but not 100% safe since it does not protect from typos and other dumb errors).

This used by be done by looking for the first partial buffer.  That does not work with the in-place sub-sampling performed by the PCM decoder:  That always reduces the size of the buffer so that all buffers only partially filled by the time they get to the leaf.  Now, a flag is set in the audio buffer flags set to indicate the final buffer in the stream.

This change alters the buffered syslog logic to use 'iob_tryalloc' instead of blocking 'iob_alloc' to avoid syslog printing from getting stuck when all IOBs are depleted by network activity.  An issue was seen when large incoming TCP transfer uses free IOB buffers and processing threads try to use syslog which then block at iob_alloc.

8eaa587c98	Jussi Kivilinna	Wed Oct 25 07:06:42 2017 -0600	sched: move POSIX thread specific data from pthread TCB to common TCB structure.  This change allows using pthread_getspecific/pthread_setspecific from main thread. Patch also enables using pthread data with config option CONFIG_DISABLE_PTHREAD=y.
75b53d563b	Jussi Kivilinna	Tue Oct 24 11:35:40 2017 -0600	mm/mm-heap: memalign: fix heap corruption caused by using unaligned chuck size.  Unaligned nodes generated by memalign later cause heap corruptions when nodes are shrink further (for example, 24 bytes -> 8 bytes, when alignment is 16 bytes).

5ef548677a	Jussi Kivilinna	Thu Oct 19 09:53:41 2017 -0600	drivrs/mtd/filemtd.c: add block device MTD interface.  Block MTD interface allows using block device directly as MTD instead of having to use file-system in between.  NOTE that this provides the opposite capability of FTL which will let you use an MTD interface directly as a block device.
d02c0c05ae	Jussi Kivilinna	Fri Oct 13 07:54:40 2017 -0600	FS FAT: Fix hard-fault when listing contents of FAT root
51ed697de1	Jussi Kivilinna	Fri Oct 13 07:37:51 2017 -0600	stm32f7 BBSRAM: stm32_bbsram: avoid assert in stm32_bbsram_savepanic.  If panic happens before stm32_bbsram is initialized, stm32_bbsram_savepanic caused additional assert panic. Function has null pointer check, so drop DEBUGASSERT.
957831d2ba	Jussi Kivilinna	Wed Oct 11 11:04:05 2017 -0600	net/socket: psock_send/psock_sendto: remove assert check for null psock and buf input pointers.  Removes check as 'psock == NULL' altogether because that checked for later in psock_send and psock_sendto. Change null check for 'buf' so that it is handled same as in recvfrom.c (return -EINVAL instead of assert).

fe7d8c941c	Jussi Kivilinna	Fri Sep 1 08:01:54 2017 -0600	stm32f7: do not enable read-modify-write on DTCM.  "AN 4667 - STM32F7 Series system architecture and performance" recommends to disable read-modify-write on DTCM: "If the DTCM-RAM is used as data location and the variables used are byte or/and halfword types, since there is no ECC management in this RAM on the STM32F7 Series, it is recommended to disable the read-modify-write of the DTCM-RAM in the DTCM interface (inthe DTCMCR register) to increase the performance."

7b8df1b930	Jussi Kivilinna	Tue Jun 13 07:35:49 2017 -0600	mtd/w25: wait for BUSY flag to clear in w25_readid and w25_unprotect.  W25Q128 datasheet says that all instructions expect 'Read Status Register' and 'Erase/Program Suspend' are ignored when BUSY flag in status register is '1'. Therefore wait for busy flag to clear in w25_readid() and w25_unprotect().

9169ff6a15	Jussi Kivilinna	Wed May 17 06:50:46 2017 -0600	stm32_serial: fix freezing serial port.  Serial interrupt enable/disable functions do not disable interrupts and can freeze device when serial interrupt is received while execution is at those functions.
a6e556d31c	Jussi Kivilinna	Tue May 16 10:56:49 2017 -0600	I had to make following change to fix interrupt context syslog (INTBUFFER untested)
ba933efd9e	Jussi Kivilinna	Thu May 11 07:11:35 2017 -0600	When syslog message has addition characters after last new-line. With buffering those now get lost as vsyslog does not flush output after lib_sprintf. Additional trailing characters could be ANSI escape sequence to reset state that message setups. For example, macro here uses colors and resets state after actual message (including '\n'):

37ca797d1c	Jussi Kivilinna	Fri Apr 28 08:42:37 2017 -0600	vfs/poll: round timeout up to next full tick.  Calling poll() with timeout less than half tick (thus MSEC2TICK(timeout) => 0) caused returning error with EAGAIN. Instead of rounding timeout down, value should be rounded up. Open Group spec for poll says:  "Implementations may place limitations on the granularity of timeout intervals. If the requested timeout interval requires a finer granularity than the implementation supports, the actual timeout interval will be rounded up to the next supported value."

In case of CONFIG_SMP=y, g_cpu0_instack_base and g_cpu1_instack_base are not allocated just after g_instack_alloc but these values show the addresses for interrupt stack of each CPU. So to set the stack pointer based on these variables, temporal register has to be used.

c8a372702a	Masayuki Ishikawa	Sun Feb 4 16:59:09 2018 -0600	sched/sched:  SMP: Fix this_task() to be an atomic operation.  In the previous implementation, this_task() was defined in sched.h by using just a macro current_task(this_cpu()).  However, I found that this is not atomic and actually sometimes switching CPU happened in executing the macro when we tested audio steaming plus executing commands via telnet.  This change resolves this issue by implementing atomic this_task()in sched_thistask.c which is newly introduced.

6e80562bf9	Matias N	Sat Mar 30 10:48:41 2019 -0600	include/nuttx/usb/hid.h:  The usbhid_descriptor_s struct defined in hid.h included some optional fields that should not be hard-defined as part of that structure.  An arbitrray number of optional entries could be included in the descriptor, but that is not properly represneted.  No code on NuttX currently depends on the structure definition with an optional descriptor so it is safe to remove.
a9d8b705cc	Matias N	Tue Mar 26 21:54:01 2019 -0600	drivers/usbdev/cdcacm.c:  This fixes a problem where the host sent a "get descriptor" message of type "standard" with a recipient of type "interface". Since the composite driver would only pass messages to the child interfaces when a message was not "standard", this message was not handled. I changed the condition so that the composite driver checks not only if this is a "standard" message but if it is also directed to the device. Otherwise, the handling is delegated to the children of the composite device.

If you have an application with an externaly pulled-up pin, this would lead to a glitch on the line that may be dangerous in some applications (e.G. Reset Line for other chips, etc).  This changes sets the output state before configuring the pin as an output.30bbeb6c1f	Paul A. Patience	Thu Dec 8 16:31:39 2016 -0500	STM32: Forgot to update chip.h for STM32F303x[BC]'s 4 ADCs

f1b2155efc	Pavel Pisa	Fri Aug 30 07:19:15 2019 -0600	tools/Makefile.* and tools/mkexport.sh:  This change allows to export builtin applications registry into temporarily created directory where export archive content is prepared.  If the Makefile in apps directory does not define export:  target then error is print but export continues without interruption. It would be more logical to print warning but there is no way instruct apps make to not print error.

The report of problems is important during development but when it enables complete informative output about load binaries then the important information can be easily overlooked.  The huge output sent to serial terminal slows loading significantly as well.

913de5e216	Pavel Pisa	Tue Aug 13 16:16:49 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/lpc17xx_40xx/lpc17_40_can.c:  f BOARD_CCLKSEL_DIVIDER is not equal to 1 on LPC178x or LPC40xx then base clock rate is calculated incorrectly because CCLK frequency does not correspond to PLL0 clock which is used for PCLK.  This  is partially workaround solution.  It would be probably better to define BOARD_PCLK_FREQUENCY even for LPC176x targets and use that to replace divisor by base_clock in up_dev_s.
fd237a87d1	Pavel Pisa	Tue Aug 13 16:12:58 2019 -0600	include/sys/syscall.h: Correct some typos.
380198c985	Pavel Pisa	Tue Aug 13 09:09:43 2019 -0600	symtab/, tools/:  NuttX provides lists of available syscalls and library functions and tools to process them.  The lists can be used to build symbol table which allows runtime program loading which can reuse functions already compiled into NuttX system image.  List processing, compilation and linking to the final system image has been possible only under manual control until now.
e3c2a0238a	Pavel Pisa	Tue Aug 13 08:58:04 2019 -0600	libs/libc/libc.csv:  Correct dependency of setlocale on CONFIG_LIBC_LOCALE.

40d666f440	Pavel Pisa	Sun Jan 27 17:45:19 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/:  The enable of EMC clocks has to be preserved when already enabled by loader.  EMC and related pins configuration has to be skipped if the system is run from SDRAM.  A region of SDRAM which is used by system must not be used for heap.
f43560c080	Pavel Pisa	Sun Jan 27 17:30:01 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc176x_clockconfig.c:  The code preserves undocumented reserved bits only if board does not set them to keep previous behavior for boards where developers (hopefully) know what values should be set into these bits.
f9ac7a22ca	Pavel Pisa	Fri Jan 25 08:24:09 2019 -0600	arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_can.c:  The name can_txready clashes with Nuttx CAN core global function.  LPC178x has only single LPC17_SYSCON_PCLKSEL with only single divisor.
7b2c2d6bec	Pavel Pisa	Thu Sep 21 17:52:05 2017 -0600	include/nuttx/net/net.h:  Add missing semicolon in prototype.  Fixes error in certain combinations of configuration options.

81a257eeb0	Pavel Pisa	Sun Aug 23 08:38:58 2015 -0600	Optional canned symtab inclusion to the build. When option CONFIG_LIBC_SYMTAB is selected and symbol table file libc/symtab/canned_symtab.inc is prepared then application can use system provided complete symbol table. The option has substantial effect on system image size. Mainly code/text. If loading of applications at runtime is not planned do not select this.  From Pavel Pisa.

c912e53344	Sebastien Lorquet	Tue Dec 18 10:19:26 2018 -0600	 crypto/aes.c: This commit provides an improved AES cipher API in addition to the existing routines.  The reasons for this new API are:  1) better performance, giving the possibility to avoid re-setting-up the key for each AES block when the same key is used multiple times. This is important for the current single user of AES, which is related to storage and FTL.  And 2) suitable for simultaneous use of multiple AES keys, which will be required by the upcoming crypto framework.  It retains compatibility with the previous API, so there is no need to change anything else right now.

d16d4d5568	Sebastien Lorquet	Tue Oct 10 17:03:56 2017 -0600	The INA219 is a combined voltage and current sensor that can measure up to 26 volts and a current that depends on an external shunt resistor.  Connection happens via i2c/smbus and the chip features a power supply rail that is independent from the measured voltage, so it can measure low voltages.

That was because stm32l4_sdmmc.h is included from the stm32l4.h global header, and this header fires an #error for other chips.  I see that ALL stm32l4 have the same SDMMC except the stm32l4x2, which has none.

4d9be9bc20	Sebastien Lorquet	Fri Jun 16 08:46:34 2017 -0600	STM32 F4 FLASH:  Enable/disable the flash write protection on any sector.  I have verified it to work on the stm32f427.
2851959dee	Sebastien Lorquet	Mon Jun 12 09:34:09 2017 -0600	MTD M2PX: If we READ while a write/erase is pending, the command is ignored and the write/erase continues. If we dont catch this situation we will return garbage to the user because the flash will not execute the command.  So READ MUST wait for write completion, and before that, the bus must be locked since it's a precondition to calling waitwritecomplete().
85645284b3	Sebastien Lorquet	Mon Jun 12 06:38:27 2017 -0600	MTD: Fix problems in SPI locking in mp25x.c driver.  Same problem probably in exists in several other drivers that derive from this this driver as well.

If not set, the default is 16-bit packed >=8-bit frames and the RXNE bit is never set (it is set when 16-bits are received). weird things as always.

From Stavros Polymenis.22dfa875fc	Stefan Kolb	Mon Aug 7 10:31:04 2017 -0600	I discovered while working on the SAMV7 mcan driver that the implementation of the CAN error handling is suboptimal. In the current implementation the following errors are implemented as pending errors:
591f35be87	Stefan Kolb	Wed May 10 07:56:17 2017 -0600	I discovered a problem in the file drivers/serial/serial.c concerning the function uart_close(…). In the case that a serial device is opened with the flag O_NONBLOCK the function uart_close(…) blocks until all data in the buffer is transmitted. The function close(…) called on an handle opened with O_NONBLOCK should not block. The problem occurred with a CDC/ACM device.

f673b2d02a	Stefan Kolb	Wed Jul 13 10:09:14 2016 -0600	This commit solves a problem which causes data loss while sending data via USB. This problem is caused by an incorrect handling of the endpoint state in the USB driver sam_usbdevhs.  This leads under some circumstances to situations in which an DMA transfer is setup while a previous DMA transfer is currently active. Amongst other things I introduced the new endpoint state USBHS_EPSTATE_SENDING_DMA for the fix.

d44ecbcfbb	Stefan Kolb	Fri May 27 07:51:50 2016 -0600	This is a fix to a problem in the handling of the oneshot timer. Due to a wrong assumption concerning the behavior directly after the start of the timer/counter the function sam_oneshot_cancel(…) calculates the wrong remaining time. The code assumes that the counter register is zero directly after the start of the timer, but this is not true. To start the time/counter a software trigger is invoked, this trigger starts the timer/count and sets the counter register to zero, but the reset of the counter register is not performed instantly. According to the datasheet: “The counter can be reset by a trigger. In this case, the counter value passes to zero on the next valid edge of the selected clock.” Thus the counter is set to zero between 0 and USEC_PER_TICK microseconds after the clock was started.

5ac6de118e	Stefan Kolb	Tue Sep 1 08:45:14 2015 -0600	libc/math/lib_asin.c: The function did not convert for some input values.  Asin did not convert for values which do not belong to the domain of the function. But aside of that the function also did not convert for sine allowed values.  I achieved a conversion of the function by reducing the DBL_EPSION and by checking if the input value is in the domain of the function. This is a fix for the problem but the function should always terminate after a given number of iterations.

fd1de92016	Vytautas Lukenskas	Fri Sep 30 07:45:39 2016 -0600	There are some small problems in LPC43xx RS485 mode configuration. In particular: 1. UART0,2,3 do not have DTR pins (different from UART1), so, Kconfig needs to be adjusted. 2. lpc43_uart.c in RS485 mode only configures DIR pin, but doesn't enable pin output for UART0,2,3. 3. should be option to reverse DIR control pin output polarity. 4. lpc43xx/chip/lpc43_uart.h doesn't have USART3 definitions.  NOTE: I didn't modified and didn't tested USART1, as it has different hardware.  From Vytautas Lukenskas.

The next time getopt() is called, this logic should detect the bad state and force the state of getopt() to be re-initialized so that it can be reused.  This logic is not full proof (it would fail, for example, if you tried to parse the same command line twice) but should catch the typical misuse cases.

4721381d1c	Xiang Xiao	Sat Jan 26 09:24:12 2019 -0600	mm/iob/iob_alloc.c:  iob_allocwait should decrease semcount manually.
9cef84b6ad	Xiang Xiao	Sat Jan 26 08:48:02 2019 -0600	mm/kmm_heap/kmm_kernel.c:  Remove unused, duplicated kmm_heapmember().

81bef6cccf	Xiang Xiao	Sat Jan 26 07:21:18 2019 -0600	arch/Kconfig and arm/src/armv7-m/Kconfig: ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT shouldn't select ARMV7M_USEBASEPRI.  First because that is a violation of the layered nature of the Kconfig architecture, but also because then Kconfig will generated errors when high priority interrupts are used with other architectures.

dbf01d12b7	Xiang Xiao	Thu Nov 15 07:11:51 2018 -0600	Assertions:  Identify the running task correctly when dumping task state information.  It takes time to switch to the target task after g_readytorun has been modified.  If panic/assert happen during this period, the dump will contain the incorrect and confusing information due to the difference between the real running task and the return value of this_task(). This change resolve this problem by adding g_running_task to track the real running task through the context switch.
f337cc1380	Xiang Xiao	Mon Nov 12 07:00:41 2018 -0600	sched/clock/ timekeeping:  Use clock_basetime() to initialize g_clock_wall_time to get the best initial RTC value and initialize g_clock_last_counter too since the hardware may not start counting from zero.
2bc709d4b9	Xiang Xiao	Mon Nov 12 06:55:53 2018 -0600	sched/clock/clock_initialize.c:  clock_inittime() needs to be done with CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS and clock_initialize should skip clock_inittime() for external RTC case since the RTC isn't ready yet.
f0c5c75042	Xiang Xiao	Mon Nov 12 06:52:56 2018 -0600	sched/clock/:  Don't call up_timer_gettime in clock_gettime and clock_systimer to ensure the return value from them consistent with clock_systimespec
46bd8798c5	Xiang Xiao	Mon Nov 12 06:50:37 2018 -0600	ched/clock/:  Remove g_monotonic_basetime and g_clock_monotonic_time since we don't need ensure monotonic time start from zero as state here: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009696899/functions/clock_getres.html

Modify the net driver to call this function in this case.  This function will simply re-inject the packet back into the network and the network driver will not put anything on the wire.
